<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Yesterday</span> morning this thing happened
to me: I was reading the <i>New York Times</i>
and my eyes suddenly fell upon one word, and
that word rang a little bell in my memory, &#8220;Kirkwall!&#8221;
The next moment I had closed my eyes
in order to see backward more clearly, and slowly,
but surely, the old, old town&ndash;&ndash;standing boldly
upon the very beach of the stormy North Sea&ndash;&ndash;became
clear in my mental vision. There was a
whole fleet of fishing boats, and a few smart smuggling
craft rocking gently in its wonderful harbour&ndash;&ndash;a
harbour so deep and safe, and so capacious
that it appeared capable of sheltering the
navies of the world.</p>
<p>I was then eighteen years old, I am now over
eighty-six; and the straits of Time have widened
and widened with every year, so that many things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
appear to have been carried away into forgetfulness
by the stress and flow of full waters. But not
so! They are only lying in out-of-the-way corners
of consciousness, and can easily be recalled by
some word that has the potency of a spell over
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirkwall!&#8221; I said softly, and then I began to
read what the <i>Times</i> had to say about Kirkwall.
The great point appeared to be that as a rendezvous
for ships it had been placed fifty miles within
the &#8220;made in Germany&#8221; danger zone, and was
therefore useless to the British men-of-war. And
I laughed inwardly a little, and began to consider
if Kirkwall had ever been long outside of some
danger zone or other.</p>
<p>All its myths and traditions are of the fighting
Picts and Scots, and when history began to notice
the existence of the Orkneys it was to chronicle
the struggle between Harold, King of Norway,
and his rebellious subjects who had fled to the
Orkneys to escape his tyrannical control. And of
the danger zones of every kind which followed&ndash;&ndash;of
storm and battle and bloody death&ndash;&ndash;does not
the Saga of Eglis give us a full account?</p>
<p>This fight for popular freedom was a failure.
King Harold conquered his rebellious subjects, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
incidentally took possession of the islands and the
people who had sheltered them. Then their rulers
became Norwegian jarls&ndash;&ndash;or earls&ndash;&ndash;and there is
no question about the danger zones into which the
Norwegian vikings carried the Orcadeans&ndash;&ndash;quite
in accord with their own desire and liking, no
doubt. And the stirring story of these years&ndash;&ndash;full
of delightful dangers to the men who adventured
them&ndash;&ndash;may all be read today in the blood-stirring,
blood-curdling Norwegian Sagas.</p>
<p>In the middle of the fifteenth century, James
the Third, King of Scotland, married Margaret
of Denmark, and the Orcades were given to Scotland
as a security for her dowry. The dowry was
never paid, and after a lapse of a century and a
half Denmark resigned all her Orcadean rights to
Scotland. The later union of England and Scotland
finally settled their destiny.</p>
<p>But until the last century England cared very
little about the Orcades. Indeed Colonel Balfour,
writing of these islands in A. D. 1861, says:
&#8220;Orkney is a part of a British County, but probably
there is no part of Europe which so few
Englishmen visit.&#8221; Colonel Balfour, of Balfour
and Trenabie, possessed a noble estate on the little
isle of Shapinsay. He enthused the Orcadeans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
with the modern spirit of improvement and progress;
he introduced a proper system of agriculture,
built mills of all kinds, got laws passed for reclaiming
waste lands, and was in every respect a
wise, generous, faithful father of his country. To
Americans Shapinsay has a peculiar interest. In a
little cottage there, called <i>Quholme</i>, the father and
mother of Washington Irving lived, and their son
Washington was born on board an American ship
on its passage from Kirkwall to New York.</p>
<p>However, it is only since A. D. 1830, one year
before I was born, that the old Norse life has
been changed in Orkney. Up to that date agriculture
could hardly be said to exist. The sheep
and cattle of all towns, or communities, grazed
together; but this plan, though it saved the labour
of herding, was at the cost of abandoning the
lambs to the eagles who circled over the flocks
and selected their victims at will. In the late
autumn all stock was brought to the &#8220;infield,&#8221;
which was then crowded with horses, cattle and
sheep. In A. D. 1830, the Norwegian system of
weights was changed to the standard weights and
measures, and money, instead of barter, began to
be used generally.</p>
<p>Then a great Scotch emigration set in, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
brought careful methods of farming with it; and
the Orcadean could not but notice results. The
Scotch trader came also, and the slipshod Norse
way of barter and bargaining had no chance with
the Scotch steady prices and ready money. But
even through all these domestic and civic changes
Orkney was constantly in zones of danger. In the
first half of the nineteenth century England was
at war with France and Spain and Russia, and
the Orcadeans have a fine inherited taste for a sea
fight. The Vikings did not rule them through centuries
for nothing: the Orcadean and his brother,
the Shetlander, salt the British Navy, and they
rather enjoy danger zones.</p>
<p>A single generation, with the help of steam communications,
changed Orkney entirely and in the
course of the second generation the Orcadean became
eager for improvements of all kinds, and
ready to forward them generously with the careful
hoardings of perhaps many generations. And
as it is in this transient period of the last century
that my hero and heroine lived, I have thought it
well to say something of antecedents that Americans
may well be excused for knowing nothing
about. Also&ndash;&ndash;</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>However, Orkney was far from being out of
danger zones in the nineteenth century. In its
first quarter French and Dutch privateers made
frequent raids on the islands; and the second quarter
gave her men their chance of danger in the
Crimea. They were not strangers in the Russian
Chersoneus; their fathers had been in southern
seas centuries before them. During the last fifty
years they have made danger zones of their own
free will, quarreling with coast guards, tampering
with smugglers, wandering off with would-be discoverers
of the North Pole, or with any other
doubtful and dangerous enterprise.</p>
<p>And these reflections made me quite comfortable
about the &#8220;made-in-Germany&#8221; danger zone. I
think the Orcadeans will rather enjoy it; and I am
quite sure if any Germans take to trafficking, or
buying or selling, in Kirkwall, they will get the
worst of it. In this direction it is rather pleasant
to remember that even Scotchmen, disputing about
money, will find the Orcadeans &#8220;too far north for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> House of Ragnor was a large and very
picturesque edifice. It was built of red and
white sandstone which Time had covered with a
heathery lichen, softening the whole into a shade
of greenish grey. Many minds and many hands
had fashioned it, for above its central door was
the date, 1688, which would presuppose that it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
been built from revenues coming as a reward for
opposition to the Stuarts. It had been altered and
enlarged by nearly every occupant, was many-roomed,
and surrounded by a large garden, full of
such small fruits as could ripen in the short summers,
and of such flowers and shrubs as could live
through the long winters. In sheltered situations,
there were even hardy roses, and a royal plenty
of England&#8217;s spring flowers sweetened many
months of the year. A homely garden, where
berries and roses grew together and privet hedges
sheltered peas and lettuce, and tulips and wall-flowers
did not disdain the proximity of household
vegetables.</p>
<p>Doubtless the Ragnors had been jarls in old
Norwegian times, but in 1853 such memories
had been forgotten, and Conall Ragnor was quite
content with his reputation of being the largest
trader in Orkney, and a very wealthy man. Physically
he was of towering stature. His hair was
light brown, and rather curly; his eyes large and
bright blue, his face broad and rosy. He had
great bodily and mental vigor, he was blunt in
speech, careless about his dress, and simple in all
his ways. His Protestantism was of the most
decided character, but he was not a Presbyterian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
Presbyterianism was a new thing on the face of
the earth; he had been &#8220;authoritatively told, the
Apostles were Episcopalians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My soul has received no orders to go to thy
Presbyterian Church,&#8221; he said to the young Calvinist
minister who asked him to do so. &#8220;When
the order comes, then that may happen which has
never happened before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet in spite of his pronounced nationality, and
his Episcopal faith, he married Rahal Gordon
from the braes of Moray; a Highland Scotch
woman and a strict Calvinist. What compact had
been made between them no one knew, but it had
been sufficient to prevent all religious disputes
during a period of twenty-six years. If Rahal
Ragnor had any respectable excuse, she did not go
to the ritual service in the Cathedral. If she had
no such excuse, she went there with her husband
and family. Then doubtless her prayer was the
prayer of Naaman, that when &#8220;she bowed herself
in the House of Rimmon, the Lord would pardon
her for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one could deny her beauty, though it was
of the Highland Scotch type, and therefore a great
contrast to the Orcadean blonde. She was slender
and dark, with plentiful, glossy, black hair, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
soft brown eyes. Her face was oval and richly
coloured. Her temperament was frank and domestic;
yet she had a romantic side, and a full appreciation
of what she called &#8220;a proper man.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had had many children, but four were
dead, and three daughters were married and living
in Edinburgh and Lerwick, and two sons had
emigrated to Canada; while the youngest of all,
a boy of fifteen, was a midshipman on Her Majesty&#8217;s
man-of-war, <i>Vixen</i>, so that only one boy
and one girl were with their parents. These were
Boris, the eldest son, who was sailing his own ship
on business ventures to French and Dutch ports,
and Thora, the only unmarried daughter. And in
1853 these five persons lived happily enough together
in the Ragnor House, Kirkwall.</p>
<p>One day in the spring of 1853 Conall Ragnor
was at the rear door of his warehouse. The sea
was lippering against its foundation, and he
stood with his hand on his left hip, as with a
raised head and keen eyes, he searched the far
horizon.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he turned with a look of satisfaction.
&#8220;Well and good!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Now
I will go home. I have the news I was watching
for.&#8221; Anon he looked at his watch and reflecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
a moment assured himself that Boris and
the <i>Sea Gull</i> would be safely at anchor by five
o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>So with an air of satisfaction he walked through
the warehouse, looking critically at the men cleaning
and packing feathers, or dried fish, or fresh
eggs. There was no sign of slacking in this department,
and he turned into the shop where men
were weighing groceries and measuring cloth. All
seemed well, and after a short delay in his own particular
office he went comfortably home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his daughter Thora was talking of
him, and wondering what news he would bring
them, and Mistress Ragnor, in a very smart cap
and a gown of dark violet silk, was knitting by
the large window in the living room&ndash;&ndash;a very comfortable
room carpeted with a good Kilmarnock
&#8220;three-ply&#8221; and curtained with red moreen. There
were a few sea pictures on the walls, and there was
a good fire of drift-wood and peat upon the snow-white
hearth.</p>
<p>Thora had just entered the room with a clean
table-cloth in her hands. Her mother gave her a
quick glance of admiration and then said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought thou wert looking for Boris home
tonight.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Mother, that is so. He said we
must give him a little dance tonight, and I have
asked the girls he likes best to come here. I
thought this was known to thee. To call my words
back now, will give great disappointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need is there to call any word back. Because
of thy dress I feared there had been some
word of delay. If likelihood rule, Maren and
Helga Torrie will wear the best they have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is most certain, but I am not minded to
outdress the Torrie girls. Very hard it is for
them to get a pretty frock, and it will make them
happy to see themselves smarter than Thora
Ragnor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou should think of thyself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am generally uppermost in my own
mind. Also, in Edinburgh I was told that the
hostess must not outdress her guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Edinburgh and Kirkwall are not in the same
latitude. Keep mind of that. Step forward and
let me look at thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Thora stood up before her mother, and the
light from the window fell all over her, and she
was beautiful from head to feet. Tall and slender,
with a great quantity of soft brown hair very
loosely arranged on the crown of her head; a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
forehead broad and white; eyebrows, plentiful and
well arched; starlike blue eyes, with a large, earnest
gaze and an oval face tinted like a rose. Oh!
why try to describe a girl so lovely? It is like
pulling a rose to pieces. It is easier to say that
she was fleshly perfect and that, being yet in her
eighteenth year, she had all the bloom of opening
flowers, and all their softness and sweetness.</p>
<p>Apparently she owed little to her dress, and
yet it would have been difficult to choose anything
more befitting her, for though it was only of wine-coloured
cashmere, it was made with a plain picturesqueness
that rendered it most effective. The
short sleeves then worn gave to her white arms
the dark background that made them a fascination;
the high waist, cut open in front to a point,
was filled in with white satin, over which it was
laced together with a thin silk cord of the same
colour as the dress. A small lace collar completed
the toilet, and for the occasion, it was perfect;
anything added to it would have made it imperfect.</p>
<p>This was the girl who, standing before her
mother, asked for her approval. And Rahal Ragnor&#8217;s
eyes were filled with her beauty, and she
could only say:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dear thing! There is no need to change!
Just as thou art pleases me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then with a face full of love Thora stooped and
kissed her mother and anon began to set the table
for the expected guests. With sandalled feet and
smiling face, she walked about the room with the
composure of a goddess. There was no hesitation
concerning what she had to do; all had been
arranged and settled in her mind previously,
though now and then, the discussion of a point
appeared to be pleasant and satisfying. Thus she
thoughtfully said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, there will be thyself and father and
Boris, that is three, and Sunna Vedder, and Helga
and Maren Torrie, that makes six, and Gath
Peterson, and Wolf Baikie and his sisters Sheila
and Maren make ten, and myself, eleven&ndash;&ndash;that is
all and it is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not make it twelve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is luck in odd numbers. I am the
eleventh. I like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou might have made it ten. There is one
girl on thy list it would be better without.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou thinking of Sunna Vedder, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am thinking of Sunna Vedder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well and good. But if Sunna is not here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Boris would feel as if there was no one present.
It is Sunna he wants to see. It is Sunna he wants
to please. He says he is so sorry for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because she has to live with old Vedder who
is nothing but a bookworm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vedder is a very clever man. The Bishop was
saying that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in a way he was saying it, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bishop was not liking the books he was
studying. He said they did men and women no
good. Thy father was telling me many things.
Yes, so it is! The Vedders are counted queer&ndash;&ndash;they
are different from thee and me, and&ndash;&ndash;the
Bishop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Dominie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may well be. Thy father has a will for
Boris to marry Andrina Thorkel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris will never marry Andrina. It would be
great bad luck if he did. Many speak ill of her.
She has a temper to please the devil. I was hearing
she would marry Scot Keppoch. That would
do; for then they would not spoil two houses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell thy father thy thought, and he will give
thee thy answer;&ndash;&ndash;but why talk of the Future and
the Maybe? The Now is the hour of the wise, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
I will go upstairs and lay out some proper clothing
and do thou get thy father to dress himself,
as Conall Ragnor ought to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may not be easy to manage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Few things are beyond thy say-so.&#8221; Then she
lifted her work-bag and left the room.</p>
<p>During this conversation Conall Ragnor had
been slowly making his way home, after leaving
his warehouse when the work of the day was
done. Generally he liked his walk through the
town to his homestead, which was just outside the
town limits. It was often pleasant and flattering.
The women came to their doors to watch him, or
to speak to him, and their admiration and friendliness
was welcome. For many years he had been
used to it, but he had not in the least outgrown
the thrill of satisfaction it gave him. And often
he wondered if his wife noticed the good opinion
that the ladies of Kirkwall had for her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she does,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;but a
great wonder it would be if my Rahal should speak
of it. In that hour she would be out of the commodity
of pride, or she would have forgotten herself
entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>This day he had received many good-natured
greetings&ndash;&ndash;Jenny Torrie had told him that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
<i>Sea Gull</i> was just coming into harbour, and so
heavy with cargo that the sea was worrying at her
gunwale; then Mary Inkster&ndash;&ndash;from the other side
of the street&ndash;&ndash;added, &#8220;Both hands&ndash;&ndash;seen and unseen&ndash;&ndash;are
full, Captain, I&#8217;ll warrant that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t thee warrant beyond thy knowledge,
Mary,&#8221; answered Ragnor, with a laugh. &#8220;The
<i>Sea Gull</i> may have hands; she has no tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All that touches the <i>Sea Gull</i> is a thing by itself,&#8221;
cried pretty Astar Graff, whose husband was
one of the <i>Sea Gull&#8217;s</i> crew.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, then, Astar, she takes her own at point and
edge. That is her way, and her right,&#8221; replied
Ragnor.</p>
<p>Thus up the narrow street, from one side or the
other, Conall Ragnor was greeted. Good wishes
and good advice, with now and then a careful innuendo,
were freely given and cheerfully taken;
and certainly the recipient of so much friendly notice
was well pleased with its freedom and good
will. He came into his own house with the smiling
amiability of a man who has had all the wrinkles
of the day&#8217;s business smoothed and soothed out of
him.</p>
<p>Looking round the room, he was rather glad his
wife was not there. She was generally cool about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
such attentions, and secretly offended by their familiarity.
For she was not only a reader and a
thinker, she was also a great observer, and she had
seen and considered the slow but sure coming of
that spirit of progress, which would break up their
isolation and, with it, the social privileges of her
class. However, she kept all her fears on this
subject in her heart. Not even to Thora would
she talk of them lest she might be an inciter of
thoughts that would raise up a class who would
degrade her own: &#8220;Few people can be trusted with
a dangerous thought, and who can tell where
spoken words go to.&#8221; And this idea, she knit, or
stitched, into every garment her fingers fashioned.</p>
<p>So, then, it was quite in keeping with her character
to pass by Conall&#8217;s little social enthusiasms
with a chilling indifference, and if any wonder or
complaint was made of this attitude, to reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;When men and women of thine own worth
and station bow down to thee, Conall, then thou
will find Rahal Ragnor among them; but I do not
mingle my words with those of the men and
women who sort goose feathers, and pack eggs and
gut fish for the salting. Thy wife, Conall, looks
up, and not down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, then, as Rahal knew that the safe return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
of Boris with the <i>Sea Gull</i> would possibly be an occasion
for these friendly familiarities, she wisely
took herself out of the way of hearing anything
about it. And it is a great achievement when we
learn the limit of our power to please. Conall
Ragnor had not quite mastered the lesson in
twenty-six years. Very often, yet, he had a half-alive
hope that these small triumphs of his daily
life might at length awaken in his wife&#8217;s breast a
sympathetic pleasure. Today it was allied with
the return of Boris and his ship, and he thought
this event might atone for whatever was repugnant.</p>
<p>And yet, after all, when he saw no one but
Thora present, he had a sense of relief. He told
her all that had been said and done, and added such
incidents of Boris and the ship as he thought would
please her. She laughed and chatted with him, and
listened with unabated pleasure to the very end,
indeed, until he said: &#8220;Now, then, I must stop talking.
I dare say there are many things to look
after, for Boris told me he would be home for
dinner at six o&#8217;clock. Till that hour I will take a
little nap on the sofa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But first, my Father, thou wilt go and dress.
Everything is ready for thee, and mother is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
dressed, and as for Thora, is she not pretty tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art the fairest of all women here, if I
know anything about beauty. Wolf Baikie will be
asking the first dance with thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That dance is thine. Mother has given thee
to me for that dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To me? That is very agreeable. I am proud
to be thy father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go and dress thyself. I am particular
about my partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dress! What is wrong with my dress?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything! Not an article in it is worthy
of thee and the occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell thee, all is as it should be. I am not
minded to change it in any way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; to please Thora, thou wilt make some
changes. Do, my Father. I love thee so! I am
so proud of thy figure, and thou can show even
Wolf Baikie how he ought to dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, just for thee&ndash;&ndash;I will wash and put
on fresh linen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And comb thy beautiful hair. If thou but wet
it, then it curls so that any girl would envy thee.
And all the women would say that it was from
thee, Thora got her bright, brown, curly hair.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To comb my hair? That is but a trifle. I will
do it to please thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thou wilt wet it, to make it curl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will do also&ndash;&ndash;to please thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, as we are to dance together, thou wilt
put on thy fine white socks, and thy Spanish leather
shoes&ndash;&ndash;the pair that have the bright buckles on
the instep. Yes, thou wilt do me that great favour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art going too far; I will not do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for thy daughter Thora?&#8221; and she laid
her cheek against his cheek, and whispered with a
kiss, &#8220;Yes, thou wilt wear the buckled shoes for
Thora. They will look so pretty in the dance:
and Wolf Baikie cannot toss his head at thy boots,
as he did at Aunt Brodie&#8217;s Christmas dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he do that thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw him, and I would not dance with him because
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou did right. Thy Aunt Barbara&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my aunt, and thy eldest sister. All she does
is square and upright; what she says, it were well
for the rest of the town to take heed to. It would
please Aunt if thou showed Wolf Baikie thou
had dancing shoes and also knew right well
how to step in them.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, thou shalt have thy way. I will
wash, I will comb my hair, I will put on clean
linen and white socks and my buckled shoes. That
is all I will do! I will not change my suit&ndash;&ndash;no,
I will not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, what call for &#8216;Father&#8217; now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want thee to wear thy kirk suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not! No, I will not! The flannel suit
is good enough for any man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if it were clean and sweet, and had no fish
scales on it, and no fish smell in it. And even here&ndash;&ndash;at
the very end of the world&ndash;&ndash;thy friend, the
good Bishop, wears black broadcloth and all gentlemen
copy him. If Thora was thy sweetheart,
instead of thy own dear daughter, she would not
dance with thee in anything but thy best suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me, my own dear daughter, that
very common people wear kirk toggery. When I
go to the hotels in Edinburgh, or Aberdeen, or Inverness,
I find all the men who wait on other men
are in kirk clothes; and if I go to a theatre, the
men who wait on the crowd there wear kirk
clothes, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy Bishop also wears black broadcloth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be because of his piety and humility.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
I am not as pious and humble as I might be. No,
indeed! Not in everything can I humour thee,
and trouble myself; but this thing is what I will
do&ndash;&ndash;I have a new suit of fine blue flannel; last
night I brought it home. At McVittie&#8217;s it was
made, and well it fits me. For thy sake I will
wear it. This is the end of our talk. No more
will I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou dear father! It is enough! With a
thousand kisses I thank thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many kisses! Too many kisses! Thou
shalt give me five when we finish our dance; one
for my curled hair, and one for my white, fresh
linen, and one for my socks, and one for my buckled
shoes, and the last for my new blue suit. And
in that bargain thou wilt get the best of me, so one
favour in return from thee I must have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Father, thy will is my will. What is thy
wish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want thy promise not to dance with Wolf
Baikie. Because of his sneer I am coaxed to dress
as I do not want to dress. Well, then, I will take
his place with thee, and every dance he asks from
thee is to be given to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation Thora replied:
&#8220;That agreement does not trouble me. It will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
to my great satisfaction. So, then, thou art no
nearer to getting the best of the bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art a clever, handsome little baggage.
But my promises I will keep, and it is well for me
to be about them. Time flies talking to thee,&#8221;
and he looked at his watch and said, &#8220;It is now
five minutes past five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then thou must make some haste. Dinner is
set for six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou think I will fiddle-faddle about myself
like a woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But thou must wash&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the North Sea I wash me every morning.
Before thou hast opened thy eyes I have had my
bath and my swim in the salt water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is rain water in thy room; try it for
a change.&#8221; And he answered her with a roar of
laughter far beyond Thora&#8217;s power to imitate.
But with it ringing in her heart and ears she saw
him go to a spare room to keep his promises.
Then she hastened to her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever is the matter with thy father,
Thora?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has promised to wash and dress. I got all
I asked for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he change his suit?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He has a fine new suit. It was hid away in
Aunt&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What made him do such a childish thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To please thee, it was done. It was to be a
surprise, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Mother! Let father have the pleasure
he planned. To thee he will come, as soon as
he is dressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I right? From top to toe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From top to toe just as thou should be. The
white roses in thy cap look lovely with the violet
silk gown. Very pretty art thou, dear Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can still wear roses, but they are white roses
now. I used to wear pink, Thora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pink and crimson and yellow roses thou may
wear yet. Because white roses go best with violet
I put that colour in thy cap for tonight. Think
of what my aunt said when thou complained to her
of growing old, &#8216;Rahal, the mother of twelve sons
and daughters is always young.&#8217; Now I will run
away, for my father does everything quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In about ten or fifteen minutes, Rahal Ragnor
heard him coming. Then she stood up and
watched the swift throwing open of the door, and
the entrance of her husband. With a cry of pleasure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
she clapped her hands and said joyfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Coll! Oh, my dear Coll!&#8221; and the next
moment Coll kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast made thyself so handsome&ndash;&ndash;just
to please me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for thee! Who else is there? Do I
please thee now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always thou pleases me! But tonight, I have
fallen in love with thee over again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet Thora wanted me to wear my kirk
suit,&#8221; and he walked to the glass and looked with
great satisfaction at himself. &#8220;I think this suit
is more becoming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Coll, thou art right. A good blue
flannel suit is a man&#8217;s natural garment. To everyone,
rich and poor, it is becoming. If thou always
dressed as thou art now dressed, I should never
have the heart or spirit to contradict thee. Thou
could have thy own way, year in and year out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the truth, my dear Rahal? Or is it a
compliment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the very truth, dear one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From this hour, then, I will dress to thy wish
and pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped quickly to his side and whispered:
&#8220;In that case, there will not be in all Scotland a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
more distinguished and proper man than Conall
Ragnor!&#8221;</p>
<p>And in a large degree Conall Ragnor was
worthy of all the fine things his wife said to him.
The new clothes fell gracefully over his grand
figure; he stepped out freely in the light easy shoes
he was wearing; there was not a single thing stiff
or tight or uncomfortable about him. Even his
shirt collar fell softly round his throat, and the
bright crimson necktie passed under it was unrestrained
by anything but a handsome pin, which
left his throat bare and gave the scarf permission
to hang as loosely as a sailor&#8217;s.</p>
<p>At length Rahal said, &#8220;I see that Boris and the
ship are safely home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ship and cargo safe in port, and every man on
board well and hearty. On the stroke of six he
will be here. He said so, and Boris keeps his
word. I hear the sound of talking and laughing.
Let us go to meet them.&#8221;</p>
<p>They came in a merry company, Boris, with
Sunna Vedder on his arm leading them. They
came joyously; singing, laughing, chattering, making
all the noise that youth seems to think is essential
to pleasure. However, I shall not describe
this evening. A dinner-dance is pretty much alike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
in all civilized and semi-civilized communities. It
will really be more descriptive to indicate a few
aspects in which this function of amusement differed
from one of the same kind given last night
in a fashionable home or hotel in New York.</p>
<p>First, the guests came all together from some
agreed-upon rendezvous. They walked, for private
carriages were very rare and there were none
for hire. However, this walking party was generally
a very pleasant introduction to a more pleasant
and intimate evening. The women were wrapped
up in their red or blue cloaks, and the men carried
their dancing slippers, fans, bouquets, and
other small necessities of the ballroom.</p>
<p>Second, the old and the young had an equal
share in any entertainment, and if there was a difference,
it was in favour of the old. On this very
night Conall Ragnor danced in every figure called,
except a saraband, which he said was too slow and
formal to be worth calling a dance. Even old
Adam Vedder who had come on his own invitation&ndash;&ndash;but
welcome all the same&ndash;&ndash;went through the
Orkney Quickstep with the two prettiest girls present,
Thora Ragnor and Maren Torrie. For honourable
age was much respected and every young
person wished to share his happiness with it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>A very marked characteristic was the evident
pleasure old and young had in the gratification of
their sense of taste, in the purely animal pleasure
of eating good things. No one had a bad appetite,
and if anyone wished for more of a dish they
liked, they asked for it. Indeed they had an easy
consciousness of paying their hostess a compliment,
and of giving themselves a little more pleasure.</p>
<p>Finally, they made the day, day; and the night,
night. Such gatherings broke up about eleven
o&#8217;clock; then the girls went home unwearied, to
sleep, and morning found them rosy and happy,
already wondering who would give them the next
dance.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Boris</span> did not remain long in the home port.
It was drawing near to Lent, and this was a
sacred term very highly regarded by the citizens
of this ancient cathedral town. Of course in the
Great Disruption the National Episcopal Church
had suffered heavy loss, but Lent was a circumstance
of the Soul, so near and dear to its memory,
that even those disloyal to their Mother Church
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
could not forget or ignore it. In some cases it was
secretly more faithfully observed than ever before;
then its penitential prayers became intensely pathetic
in their loneliness. For these self-bereft
souls could not help remembering the days when
they went up with the multitude to keep the Holy
Fast in the House of their God.</p>
<p>Rahal Ragnor had never kept it. It had been
only a remnant of popery to her. Long before the
Free Kirk had been born, she and all her family
had been Dissenters of some kind or other. And
yet her life and her home were affected by this
Episcopal &#8220;In Memoriam&#8221; in a great number of
small, dominating ways, so that in the course of
years she had learned to respect a ceremonial that
she did not endorse. For she knew that no one
kept Lent with a truer heart than Conall Ragnor,
and that the Lenten services in the cathedral interfered
with his business to an extent nothing
purely temporal would have been permitted to do.</p>
<p>So, after the little dance given to Boris, there
was a period of marked quietness in Kirkwall. It
was as if some mighty Hand had been laid across
the strings of Life and softened and subdued all
their reverberations. There was no special human
influence exerted for this purpose, yet no one could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
deny the presence of some unseen, unusual element.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day seems like Sabbath Day,&#8221; said
Thora.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Lent,&#8221; answered Rahal.</p>
<p>&#8220;And after Lent comes Easter, dear Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime Boris had gone to Edinburgh
on the bark <i>Sea Gull</i> to complete his cargo of
Scotch ginghams and sewed muslins, native jewelry
and table delicacies. Perhaps, indeed, the minimum
notice accorded Lent in the metropolitan city
had something to do with this journey, which was
not a usual one; but after the departure of the
<i>Sea Gull</i> the Ragnor household had settled down
to a period of domestic quiet. The Master had
to make up the hours spent in the cathedral by a
longer stay in the store, and the women at this
time generally avoided visiting; they felt&ndash;&ndash;though
they did not speak of it&ndash;&ndash;the old prohibition of
unkind speech, and the theological quarrel was yet
so new and raw that to touch it was to provoke
controversy, instead of conversation.</p>
<p>It was at such vacant times that old Adam Vedder&#8217;s
visits were doubly welcome. One day in
mid-Lent he came to the Ragnor house, when it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
was raining with that steady deliberation that gives
no hope of anything better. Throwing off his
waterproof outer garments, he left them to drip
dry in the kitchen. An old woman, watching him,
observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art wetting the clean floor, Master Vedder,&#8221;
and he briskly answered: &#8220;That is thy business,
Helga, not mine. Is thy mistress in the
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would she be out, if she had any good sense
left?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can a man tell what a woman will do?
Where is thy mistress?&#8221; and he spoke in a tone so
imperative, that she answered with shrinking humility:</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask thy favour. Mistress Ragnor is in the
right-hand parlour. I will look after thy cloak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be well for thee to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Adam went to the right-hand parlour and
found Rahal sitting by the fire sewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see thee, Rahal,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see thee always&ndash;&ndash;more at this
time than at any other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is good, but why at this time more
than at any other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The town is depressed; business goes on, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
in a silent fashion. There is no social pleasure&ndash;&ndash;surely
the reason is known to thee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is, and the reason is good. When people
are confessing their sins, and asking pardon for
the same, they cannot feel it to be a cheerful entertainment;
and, as thou observed, it affects even
their business, which I myself notice is done without
the usual joking or quarrelling or drinking of
good healths. Well, then, that also is right.
Where is Thora?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is going to a lecture this afternoon to be
given by the Archdeacon Spens to the young girls,
and she is preparing for it.&#8221; And as these words
were uttered, Thora entered the room. She was
dressed for the storm outside, and wore the hood
of her cloak drawn well over her hair; in her hands
were a pair of her father&#8217;s slippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;For thee I brought them,&#8221; she said, as she
held them out to Vedder. &#8220;I heard thy voice, and
I was sure thy feet would be wet. See, then, I
have brought thee my father&#8217;s slippers. He would
like thee to wear them&ndash;&ndash;so would I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not wear them, Thora. I will not stand
in any man&#8217;s shoes but my own. It is an unchancy,
unlucky thing to do. Thanks be to thee, but I will
keep my own standing, wet or dry. Look to that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
rule for thyself, and remember what I say. Let
me see if thou art well shod.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thora laughed, stood straight up, and drew her
dress taut, and put forward two small feet, trigly
protected by high-laced boots. Then, looking at
her mother, she asked: &#8220;Are the boots sufficient,
or shall I wear over them my French clogs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vedder answered her question. &#8220;The clogs are
not necessary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The rain runs off as
fast as it falls. Thy boots are all such trifling feet
can carry. What can women do on this hard
world-road with such impediments as French clogs
over English boots?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Vedder, they will do whatever they want
to do; and they will go wherever they want to go;
and they will walk in their own shoes, and work
in their own shoes, and be well satisfied with
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora, I am sorry I was born in the last century.
If I had waited for about fifty years I would
have been in proper time to marry thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; for I would not have let a woman so fair
and good as thou art go out of my family. We
should have been man and wife. That would certainly
have happened.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If two had been willing, it might have been.
Now our talk must end; the Archdeacon likes not
a late comer;&#8221; and with this remark, and a beaming
smile, she went away.</p>
<p>Then there was a silence, full of words longing
to be spoken; but Rahal Ragnor was a prudent
woman, and she sighed and sewed and left Vedder
to open the conversation. He looked at her
a little impatiently for a few moments, then he
asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;To what port has thy son Boris sailed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris intends to go to Leith, if wind and water
let him do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris is not asking wind and water about his
affairs. There is a question I know not how to
answer. I am wanting thy help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that be so, speak thy mind to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a few words of advice about a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that woman thy granddaughter, Sunna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A right guess thou hast made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I would rather not speak of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy reason? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is too clever for a simple woman like me.
I have not two faces. I cannot make the same
words mean two distinct and separate things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Sunna has all thy self-wisdom, but she has not thy
true heart and thy wise tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me! Things have come to this&ndash;&ndash;Boris
has made love to Sunna in the face of all
Kirkwall. He has done this for more than a
year. Then for two weeks before he left for
Leith he came not near my house, and if he met
Sunna in any friend&#8217;s house he was no longer her
lover. What is the meaning of this? My girl is
unhappy and angry, and I myself am far from being
satisfied; thou tell, what is wrong between
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would prefer neither to help nor hinder thee
in this matter. There is a broad way between
these two ways, that I am minded to take. It will
be better for me to do so, and perhaps better for
thee also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I could count on thee for my friend.
Bare is a man&#8217;s back without friends behind it!
In thee I trusted. While I feared and doubted, I
thought, &#8216;If worse comes I will go at once to Rahal
Ragnor&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Thou hast failed me</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say not that&ndash;&ndash;my old, dear friend! It is beyond
truth. What I know I told to my husband;
and I asked him if it would be kind and well to
tell thee, and he said to me: &#8216;Be not a bearer of ill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
news to Vedder. Little can thou trust any evil
report; few people are spoken of better than they
deserve.&#8217; Then I gave counsel to myself, thus:
Conall has four dear daughters, <i>he knows</i>. Conall
loves his old friend Vedder; if he thought to interfere
was right, he would advise Vedder to interfere
or he would interfere for him, and my
wish was to spare thee the sorrow that comes from
women&#8217;s tongues. I was also sure that if the
news was true, it would find thee out&ndash;&ndash;if not true,
why should Rahal Ragnor sow seeds of suspicion
and ill-will? Is Sunna disobedient to thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is something worse&ndash;&ndash;she deceives me.
Her name is mixed up with some report&ndash;&ndash;I know
not what. No one loves me well enough to tell
me what is wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, thou art more feared than loved.
Few know thee well enough to risk thy anger and
all know that Norsemen are bitter cruel to those
who dare to say that one hair of their women is
out of its place. Who, then, would dare to say
this or that about thy granddaughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rahal Ragnor could speak safely to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was silence for a few moments and
Rahal sat with her doubled-up left hand against
her lips, gazing out of the window. Vedder did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
not disturb her. He waited patiently until she
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I tell thee what was told me, wilt thou visit
the story upon my husband, or myself, or any of
my children?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vedder took a signet ring from his finger and
kissed it. &#8220;Rahal,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have kissed this
ring of my fathers to seal the promise I shall make
thee. If thou wilt give me thy confidence in this
matter of Sunna Vedder, it shall be for thy good,
and for the good of thy husband, and for the good
of all thy children, as far as Adam Vedder can
make it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask a special promise for my son Boris, for
he is concerned in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris can take good care of Boris: nevertheless,
I promise thee that I will not say or look or
do, with hands or tongue, anything that will injure,
or even annoy, Boris Ragnor. Unto the end of
my life, I promise this. What may come after, I
know not. If there should be a wrong done, we
will fight it out elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy words are sufficient. Listen, then!
There is a family, in the newest and best part of
the town, called McLeod. They are yet strange
here. They are Highland Scotch. Many say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
they are Roman Catholics. They sing Jacobite
songs, and they go not to any church. They have
opened a great trading route; and they have
brought many new customs and new ideas with
them. A certain class of our people make much
of them; others are barely civil to them; the best
of our citizens do not notice them at all. But
they have plenty of money, and live extravagantly,
and the garrison&#8217;s officers are constantly seen
there. Do you know them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McLeod has a large trading fleet, and he has
interfered with the business of Boris in many
ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hast thou ever seen him? Tell me what he is
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen him many times. He is a complete
Highlander; tall, broad-shouldered and apparently
very strong, also very graceful. He has high
cheekbones, and a red beard, but all talk about
him, and many think him altogether handsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thou? What dost thou think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw him, he was in earnest discussion
with one of his men, and he was not using English
but sputtering a torrent of shrill Gaelic, shrugging
his shoulders, throwing his arms about, thrilling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
with excitement&ndash;&ndash;but for all that, he was the
picture of a man that most women would find irresistible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard that he wears the Highland
dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on the street. They have many entertainments;
he may wear it in some of them; but I
think he is too wise to wear it in public. The
Norseman is much indebted to the Scot&ndash;&ndash;but it
would not do to flaunt the feathered cap and philabeg
too much&ndash;&ndash;on Kirkwall streets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am Highland Scotch, thank God! I
understand this man, though I have never spoken
to him. I know little about the Lowland Scot. He
is a different race, and is quite a different man.
You would not like him, Adam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know him. He is a fine fellow; quiet, cool-blooded,
has little to say, and wastes no strength
in emotion. There&#8217;s wisdom for you&ndash;&ndash;but go on
with thy talk, woman; it hurts me, but I must hear
it to the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Kenneth McLeod has the appearance
of a gentleman, though he is only a trader.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say <i>smuggler</i>, Rahal, and you might call him
by a truer name.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Many whisper the same word. Of a smuggler,
a large proportion of our people think no
wrong. That you know. He is a kind of hero to
some girls. Many grand parties these McLeods
give&ndash;&ndash;music and dancing, and eating and drinking,
and the young officers of the garrison are there, as
well as our own gay young men; and where these
temptations are, young women are sure to go.
His aunt is mistress of his house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, this thing happened when Boris
was last here. One night he heard two men talking
as they went down the street before him. The
rain was pattering on the flagged walk and he
did not well understand their conversation, but it
was altogether of the McLeods and their entertainments.
Suddenly he heard the name of Sunna
Vedder. Thrice he heard it, and he followed the
men to the public house, called for whiskey, sat
down at a table near them and pretended to be
writing. But he grew more and more angry as
he heard the free and easy talk of the men; and
when again they named Sunna, he put himself into
their conversation and so learned they were going
to McLeod&#8217;s as soon as the hour was struck for
the dance. Boris permitted them to go, laughing
and boastful; an hour afterwards he followed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&#8220;With whom did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone he went. The dance was then in progress,
and men and women were constantly going
in and out. He followed a party of four, and
went in with them. There was a crowd on the
waxed floor. They were dancing a new measure
called the polka; and conspicuous, both for her
beauty and her dress, he saw Sunna among them.
Her partner was Kenneth McLeod, and he was in
full McLeod tartans. No doubt have I that
Sunna and her handsome partner made a romantic
and lovely picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What must be the end of all this? What the
devil am I to think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think no worse than needs be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Boris do&ndash;&ndash;or say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He walked rapidly to Sunna, and he said,
&#8216;Miss Vedder, thou art wanted at thy home&ndash;&ndash;at
once thou art wanted. Get thy cloak, and I will
walk with thee.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was angry, and yet terrified; but she left
the room. Boris feared she would try and escape
him, so he went to the door to meet her. Judge
for thyself what passed between them as Boris
took her home. At first she was angry, afterwards,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
she cried and begged Boris not to tell thee.
I am sure Boris was kind to her, though he told
her frankly she was on a dangerous road. All
this I had from Boris, and it is the truth; as for
what reports have grown from it, I give them no
heed. Sunna was deceitful and imprudent. I
would not think worse of her than she deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rahal, I am much thy debtor. This affair I
will now take into my own hands. To thee, my
promise stands good for all my life days&ndash;&ndash;and
thou may tell Boris, it may be worth his while to
forgive Sunna. There is some fault with him
also; he has made love to Sunna for a long time,
but never yet has he said to me&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;I wish to make
Sunna my wife!&#8217; What is the reason of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Adam, a young man wishes to
make sure of himself. Boris is much from
home&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is! For that very cause, he should
have made a straight clear road between us. I do
not excuse Sunna, but I say that wherever there is
a cross purpose, there has likely never been a
straight one. Thou hast treated me well, and I
am thy debtor; but it shall be ill with all those who
have led my child wrong&ndash;&ndash;the more so, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
the time chosen for their sinful deed makes it immeasurably
more sinful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The time? What is thy meaning? The time
was the usual hour of all entertainments. Even
two hours after the midnight is quite respectable
if all else is correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou so forgetful of the God-Man, who
at this time carried the burden of all our sins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! You mean it is Lent, Adam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! It is Lent!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never taught to regard it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet none keep Lent more strictly than Conall
Ragnor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wife does not always adopt her husband&#8217;s
ideas. I had a father, Adam, uncles and cousins
and friends. None of them kept Lent. Dost
thou expect me to be wiser than all my kindred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us cease this talk. It will come to nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be not hard on Sunna. One side only, has
been heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As kindly as may be, I will do right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Adam went away, but he left Rahal very
unhappy. She had disobeyed her husband&#8217;s advice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
and she could not help asking herself if she
would have been as easily persuaded to tell a similar
story about her own child. &#8220;Thora is a school
girl yet,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;but she is just entering the
zone of temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the midst of this reflection Thora came into
the room. Her mother looked into her lovely
face with a swift pang of fear. It was radiant
with a joy not of this world. A light from an interior
source illumined it; a light that wreathed
with smiles the pure, childlike lips. &#8220;Oh, if she
could always remain so young, and so innocent!
Oh, if she never had to learn the sorrowful lessons
that love always teaches!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus Rahal thought and wished. She forgot,
as she did so, that women come into this world
to learn the very lessons love teaches, and that
unless these lessons are learned, the soul can make
no progress, but must remain undeveloped and uninstructed,
even until the very end of this session
of its existence.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It</span> was Saturday morning and the next day was
Easter Sunday. The little town of Kirkwall
was in a state of happy, busy excitement, for
though the particular house cleaning of the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
occasion was finished, every housewife was full
laden with the heavy responsibility of feeding the
guests sure to arrive for the Easter service. Even
Rahal Ragnor had both hands full. She was expecting
her sister-in-law, Madame Barbara Brodie
by that day&#8217;s boat, and nobody ever knew how
many guests Aunt Barbara would bring with her.
Then if her own home was not fully prepared to
afford them every comfort, she would be sure to
leave them at the Ragnor house until all was in
order. Certainly she had said in her last letter
that she was not &#8220;going to be imposed upon, by
anyone this spring&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and Thora reminded her
mother of this fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou indeed believe thy aunt&#8217;s assurances?&#8221;
asked Rahal. &#8220;Hast thou not seen her
break them year after year? She will either ask
some Edinburgh friend to come back to Kirkwall
with her, or she will pick up someone on the way
home. Is it not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt generally leaves Edinburgh alone. It is
the people she picks up on her way home that are
so uncertain. Dear Mother, can I go now to the
cathedral? The flowers are calling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there many flowers this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than we expected. The Balfour greenhouse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
has been stripped and they have such a
lovely company of violets and primroses and white
hyacinths with plenty of green moss and ivy. The
Baikies have a hothouse and have such roses and
plumes of curled parsley to put behind them, and
lilies-of-the-valley; and I have robbed thy greenhouse,
Mother, and taken all thy fairest auriculas
and cyclamens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are for God&#8217;s altar. All I have is His.
Take what vases thou wants, but Helga must
carry them for thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Mother, can I have the beautiful white
Wedgewood basket for the altar? It looked so
exquisite last Easter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It now belongs to the altar. I gave it freely
last Easter. I promised then that it should never
hold flowers again for any meaner festival. Take
whatever thou wants for thy purpose, and delay
me no longer. I have this day to put two days&#8217;
work into one day.&#8221; Then she lifted her eyes
from the pastry she was making and looking at
Thora, asked: &#8220;Art thou not too lightly clothed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have warm underclothing on. Thou would
not like me to dress God&#8217;s altar in anything but
pure white linen? All that I wear has been made
spotless for this day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is right, but now thou must make some
haste. There is no certainty about Aunt Barbie.
She may be at her home this very minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boat is not due until ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless Barbara Brodie wanted to land at
seven. Then, if she wished, winds and waves
would have her here at seven. Her wishes follow
her like a shadow. Go thy way now. Thou art
troubling me. I believe I have put too much
sugar in the custard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that would be a thing incredible.&#8221; Then
Thora took a hasty kiss, and went her way. A
large scarlet cloak covered her white linen dress,
and its hood was drawn partially over her head.
In her hands she carried the precious Wedgewood
basket, and Helga and her daughter had charge
of the flowers and of several glass vases for their
reception. In an hour all Thora required had
been brought safely to the vestry of Saint Magnus,
and then she found herself quite alone in this
grand, dim, silent House of God.</p>
<p>In the meantime Aunt Barbara Brodie had done
exactly as Rahal Ragnor anticipated. The boat
had made the journey in an abnormally short
time. A full sea, and strong, favourable winds,
had carried her through the stormiest Firth in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
Scotland, at a racer&#8217;s speed; and she was at her
dock, and had delivered all her passengers when
Conall Ragnor arrived at his warehouse. Then
he had sent word to Rahal, and consequently she
ventured on the prediction that &#8220;Aunt Barbara
might already be at her home.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, it had not been told the Mistress of
Ragnor, that her sister-in-law had actually &#8220;picked
up someone on the way&#8221;; and that for this reason
she had gone directly to her own residence.
For on this occasion, her hospitality had been
stimulated by a remarkably handsome young man,
who had proved to be the son of Dr. John Macrae,
a somewhat celebrated preacher of the most
extreme Calvinist type. She heartily disapproved
of the minister, but she instantly acknowledged
the charm of his son; but without her brother&#8217;s
permission she thought it best not to hazard
his influence over the inexperienced Thora.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am fifty-two years old,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;and I
know the measure of a man&#8217;s deceitfulness, so I
can take care of myself, but Thora is a childlike
lassie. It would not be fair to put her in danger
without word or warning. The lad has a wonderful
winning way with women.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she took her fascinating guest to her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
residence, and when he had been refreshed by a
good breakfast, he frankly said to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;I came here on special business. I have a
large sum of money to deliver, and I think I will
attend to that matter at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not hinder thee,&#8221; said Mrs. Brodie, &#8220;I&#8217;m
no way troubled to take care of my own money,
but it is just an aggravation to take care of other
folks&#8217; siller. And who may thou be going to give
a &#8216;large sum of money&#8217; to, in Kirkwall town? I
wouldn&#8217;t wonder if the party isn&#8217;t my own brother,
Captain Conall Ragnor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mistress,&#8221; the young man replied. &#8220;It
belongs to a young gentleman called McLeod.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! A trading man is whiles very little
of a gentleman. What do you think of McLeod?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the manager of his Edinburgh business,
so I cannot discuss his personality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, laddie! Folks seldom see any
good thing in their employer; and it is quite fair
for them to be just as blind to any bad thing in
him&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;ll tell you frankly that your employer
has not a first rate reputation here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mistress Brodie! His reputation is
not in my charge&ndash;&ndash;only his money. I do not
think the quality of his reputation can hurt mine.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s reputation will stand bail for
yours. Well now, run away and get business off
your mind, and be back here for one o&#8217;clock dinner.
I will not wait a minute after the clock chaps
one. This afternoon I am going to my brother&#8217;s
house, and I sent him a message which asks for
permission to bring you with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; but he said the word in an unthankful
tone, and then he looked into Mistress Brodie&#8217;s
face, and she laughed and imitated his expression,
as she assured him &#8220;she had no girl with
matrimonial intentions in view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Mistress,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do not intend
to remain longer than a week. Why should I run
into danger? I am ready to take heartaches.
Can you tell me how best to find McLeod&#8217;s warehouse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speir at any man you meet, and any man will
show you the place. I, myself, am not carin&#8217; to
send folk an ill road.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Ian Macrae went into the town and easily
found his friend and employer. Then their business
was easily settled and it appeared to be every
way gratifying to both men.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have taken a business I hate off my hands,
Ian,&#8221; said McLeod, &#8220;and I am grateful to you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Where shall we go today? What would you like
to do with yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Kenneth, I would like first of all to see
the inside of your grand cathedral. I would say,
it must be very ancient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Began in A. D., 1138. Is that old?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven hundred years! That will do for age.
They were good builders then. I have a strange
love for these old shrines where multitudes have
prayed for centuries. They are full of <i>Presence</i>
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Presence.</i> What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Souls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a creepy kind of mortal. I think, Ian,
if you were not such a godless man, you might
have been a saint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macrae drew his lips tight, and then said in
detached words&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;My father is&ndash;&ndash;sure&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;was&ndash;&ndash;born&ndash;&ndash;at&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;other&ndash;&ndash;end&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;measure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they were in the interior of the cathedral.
The light was dim, the silence intense, and both
men were profoundly affected by influences unknown
and unseen. As they moved slowly forward
into the nave, the altar became visible, and
in this sacred place of Communion Thora was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
moving slowly about, leaving beauty and sweetness
wherever she lingered.</p>
<p>Her appearance gave both men a shock and
both expressed it by a spasmodic breath. They
spoke not; they watched her slim, white figure
pass to-and-fro with soft and reverent steps, arranging
violets and white hyacinths with green
moss in the exquisite white Wedgewood. Then
with a face full of innocent joy she placed it upon
the altar, and for a few moments stood with
clasped hands, looking at it.</p>
<p>As she did so, the organist began to practice his
Easter music, and she turned her face towards the
organ. Then they saw fully a beautiful, almost
childlike face transfigured with celestial emotions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us get out of this,&#8221; whispered McLeod.
&#8220;What business have we here? It is a kind of
sacrilege.&#8221; And Ian bowed his head and followed
him. But it was some minutes ere the every-day
world became present to their senses.
McLeod was the first to speak:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What an experience!&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;I should
not dare to try it often. It would send me into a
monastery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a Roman Catholic?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else would I be? When I was a lad,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
I used to dream of being a monk. It was power I
wanted. I thought then, that priests had more
power than any other men; as I grew older I
found out that it was money that owned the
earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so!&#8221; said Ian sharply, &#8220;&#8216;the earth is the
Lord&#8217;s, and the fulness thereof.&#8217; I promised to be
at Mistress Brodie&#8217;s for dinner at one o&#8217;clock.
What is the time?&#8221;</p>
<p>McLeod took out his watch:&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;You have
twenty minutes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was just going to
tell you that the girl we saw in the cathedral is
her niece.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ian had taken a step or two in the direction of
the Brodie house, but he turned his head, and
with a bright smile said, &#8220;Thank you, Ken!&#8221; and
McLeod watched him a moment and then with a
sigh softly ejaculated: &#8220;What a courteous chap
he is&ndash;&ndash;when he is in the mood to be courteous&ndash;&ndash;and
what a &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; when he is not in the mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ian was at the Brodie house five minutes before
one, and he found Mistress Brodie waiting for
him. &#8220;I am glad that you have kept your tryst,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We will just have a modest bite now,
and we can make up all that is wanting here, at
my brother Coll&#8217;s, a little later. I have a pleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
invite for yourself. My good sister-in-law has
read some of your father&#8217;s sermons in the Sunday
papers and magazines, and for their sake she will
be glad to see you. I just promised for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I shall be glad to go with you,&#8221;
and it was difficult for him to disguise how more
than glad he was to have this opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;So then, you will put on the best you have with
you&ndash;&ndash;the best is none too good to meet Thora in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora Ragnor, my own niece. She is the bonniest
and the best girl in Scotland, if you will take
me as a judge of girls. &#8216;Good beyond the lave of
girls,&#8217; and so Bishop Hadley asked her special
to dress the altar for Easter. He knew there
would be no laughing and daffing about the work,
if Thora Ragnor had the doing of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any reason to refrain from laughing
and daffing while at that work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At God&#8217;s altar there should be nothing but
prayer and praise. You know what girls talk
and laugh about. If they have not some poor
lad to bring to worship, or to scorn, they have no
heart to help their hands; and the work is done
silent and snappy. They are wishing they were at
home, and could get their straight, yellow hair on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
to crimping pins, because Laurie or Johnny would
be coming to see them, it being Saturday night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the Bishop thought your niece would be
more reverent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew she would. He knew also, that she
would not be afraid to be in the cathedral by herself,
she would do the work with her own hands,
and that there would be no giggling and gossiping
and no young lads needed to hold vases and scissors
and little balls of twine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their &#8220;moderate bite&#8221; was a pleasant lingering
one. They talked of people in Edinburgh with
whom they had some kind of a mutual acquaintance,
and Mistress Brodie did the most of the
talking. She was a charming story-teller, and she
knew all the good stories about the University
and its great professors. This day she spent the
time illustrating John Stuart Blackie taking his
ease in a dressing gown and an old straw hat. She
made you see the man, and Ian felt refreshed and
cheered by the mental vision. As for Lord Roseberry,
he really sat at their &#8220;modest bite&#8221; with
them. &#8220;You know, laddie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Scotsmen
take their politics as if they were the Highland
fling; and Roseberry was Scotland&#8217;s idol. He was
an orator who carried every soul with him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
whether they wanted to go or not; and I was
told by J. M. Barrie, that once when he had fired
an audience to the delirium point, an old man in
the hall shouted out:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;I dinna hear a word; but
it&#8217;s grand; it&#8217;s grand!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>They barely touched on Scottish religion. Mistress
Brodie easily saw it was a subject her guest
did not wish to discuss, and she shut it off from
conversation, with the finality of her remark that
&#8220;some people never understood Scotch religion,
except as outsiders misunderstood it. Well, Ian,
I will be ready for our visit in about two hours;
one hour to rest after eating and a whole hour to
dress myself and lecture the lasses anent behaving
themselves when they are left to their own idle
wishes and wasteful work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in two hours I will be ready to accompany
you; and in the meantime I will walk over
the moor and smoke a cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, better go down to the beach and watch
the puffins flying over the sea, and the terns fishing
about the low lying land. Or you might get
a sight of an Arctic skua going north, or a black
guillemot with a fish in its mouth flying fast to
feed its young. The seaside is the place, laddie!
There is something going on there constantly.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>So Ian went to the seaside and found plenty of
amusement there in watching a family quarrel
among the eider ducks, who were feeding on the
young mussels attached to the rocks which a low
tide had uncovered.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant walk to the Ragnor home,
and Rahal and Thora were expecting them. The
sitting room was cheery with sunshine and fire
glow, Rahal was in afternoon dress and Thora
was sitting near the window spinning on the little
wheel the marvellously fine threads of wool made
from the dwarfish breed of Shetland sheep, and
used generally for the knitting of those delicate
shawls which rivalled the finest linen laces. On
the entrance of her aunt and Ian Macrae she rose
and stood by her wheel, until the effusive greetings
of the two elder ladies were complete; and
Ian was utterly charmed with the picture she made&ndash;&ndash;it
was completely different from anything he had
ever seen or dreamed about.</p>
<p>The wheel was a pretty one, and was inlaid
with some bright metal, and when Thora rose
from her chair she was still holding a handful of
fine snowy wool. Her blue-robed and blue-eyed
loveliness appeared to fill the room as she stood
erect and smiling, watching her mother and aunt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
But when her aunt stepped forward to introduce
Ian to her, she turned the full light of her lovely
countenance upon him. Then both wondered
where they had met before. Was it in dreams
only?</p>
<p>Mother and aunt were soon deep in the fascinating
gossip of an Edinburgh winter season, and
Thora and Ian went into the greenhouse and the
garden and found plenty to talk about until Conall
Ragnor came home from business and supper was
served. And the wonder was, that Conall bent to
the young man&#8217;s charm as readily as Thora had
done. He was amazed at his shrewd knowledge
of business methods and opportunities; and listened
to him with grave attention, though laughing
heartily at some of his plans and propositions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Macrae,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thou art too far north
for me. I do know a few Shetlanders that could
pare the skin off thy teeth, but we Orcadeans are
simple honest folk that just live, and let live.&#8221;
At which remark Ian laughed, and reminded
Conall Ragnor of certain transactions in railway
stock which had nonplussed the Perth directors at
the time. Then Ragnor asked how he happened
to know what was generally considered &#8220;private
information,&#8221; and Ian answered, &#8220;Private information
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
is the most valuable, sir. It is what I
look for.&#8221; Then Ragnor rose from the table and
said, &#8220;Let us have a smoke and a little music.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take thy smoke, Coll,&#8221; said Mrs. Ragnor,
&#8220;and Mr. Macrae will give us the music. Barbara
says he sings better than Harrison. Come,
Mr. Macrae, we are waiting to hear thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ian made no excuses. He sat down and sang
with delightful charm and spirit &#8220;A Life on the
Ocean Wave&#8221; and &#8220;The Bay of Biscay.&#8221; Then
these were followed by the fresh and then popular
songs, &#8220;We May Be Happy Yet,&#8221; &#8220;Then You&#8217;ll
Remember Me&#8221; and &#8220;The Land of Our Birth.&#8221;
No one spoke or interrupted him, even to praise;
but he was well repaid by the look on every face
and the kindness that flowed out to him. He could
see it in the eyes, and hear it in the voices, and
feel it in the manner of all present.</p>
<p>The silence was broken by the sound of quick,
firm footsteps. Ragnor listened a moment and
then went with alacrity to open the door. &#8220;I knew
it was thee!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;O sir, I am glad to see
thee! Come in, come in! None can be more
welcome!&#8221; And it was good to hear the strong,
sweet modulations of the voice that answered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Bishop Hedley!&#8221; said Rahal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then I am going,&#8221; said Aunt Barbara.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Aunt!&#8221; cried Thora, and the next
moment she was at her aunt&#8217;s side coaxing her to
resume her chair. Then the Bishop and Ragnor
entered the room, and the moment the Bishop&#8217;s
face shone upon them, all talk about leaving the
room ceased. For Bishop Hedley carried his
Great Commission in his face and his life was a
living sermon. His soul loved all mankind; and
he had with it an heroic mind and a strong-sinewed
body, which refused to recognise the fact
that it died daily. For the Bishop&#8217;s business was
with the souls of men, and he lived and moved
and did his daily work in a spiritual and eternal
element.</p>
<p>And if constant commerce with the physical
world weakens and ages the man who lives and
works in it, surely the life passed amid spiritual
thoughts and desires is thereby fortified and
strengthened to resist the cares and worries which
fret the physical body to decay. Then vainly the
flesh fades, the soul makes all things new. This
is a great truth&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it is only by the supernatural
we are strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bishop came in bringing with him, not only
the moral tonic of his presence, but also the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
breath of the sea; its refreshing &#8220;tang,&#8221; and good
salt flavour. His smile and blessing was a spiritual
sunshine that warmed and cheered and brightened
the room. He was affectionate to all, but to
Mistress Brodie and Ian Macrae, he was even
more kindly than to the Ragnors. They were not
of his flock but he longed to take care of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard singing as I came through the garden,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and it was not your voice, Conall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Ian Macrae singing,&#8221; Conall answered,
&#8220;and he will gladly sing for thee, sir.&#8221; This
promise Macrae ratified at once, and that with
such power and sweetness that every one was
amazed and the Bishop requested him to sing,
during the next day&#8217;s service, a fine &#8220;Gloria&#8221; he
had just given them in the cathedral choir. And
Ian said he would see the organist, and if it could
be done, he would be delighted to obey his request.</p>
<p>&#8220;See the organist!&#8221; exclaimed Mistress Brodie.
&#8220;What are you talking about? The organist is
Sandy Odd, the barber&#8217;s son! How can the like
of him hinder the Bishop&#8217;s wish?&#8221; Then the
Bishop wrote a few words in his pocket book, tore
out the leaf, and gave it to Macrae, saying: &#8220;Mr.
Odd will manage all I wish, no doubt. Now, sir,
for my great pleasure, play us &#8216;Home, Sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Home.&#8217; I have not been here for four months,
and it is good to be with friends again.&#8221; And they
all sang it together, and were perfectly at home
with each other after it. So much so, that the
Bishop asked Rahal to give him a cup of tea and
a little bread; &#8220;I have come from Fair Island today,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and have not eaten since noon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then all the women went out together to prepare
and serve the requested meal, so that it came
with wonderful swiftness, and beaming smiles, and
charming words of laughing pleasure. And when
he saw a little table drawn to the hearth for him
and quickly spread with the food he needed and
smelled the refreshing odour of the young Hyson,
and heard the pleasant tinkle of china and glass
and silver as Thora placed them before the large
chair he was to occupy, he sat down happily to
eat and drink, while Thora served him, and Conall
smoked and watched them with a now-and-then
smile or word or two, while Rahal and Barbara
talked, and Ian played charmingly&ndash;&ndash;with soft
pedal down&ndash;&ndash;quotations from Beethoven&#8217;s &#8220;Pastoral
Symphony&#8221; and &#8220;Hark, &#8217;Tis the Linnet!&#8221;
from the oratorio, &#8220;Joshua.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a delightful interlude in which every one
was happy in their own way, and so healed by it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
of all the day&#8217;s disappointments and weariness.
But the wise never prolong such perfect moments.
Even while yielding their first satisfactions, they
permit them to depart. It is a great deal to
<i>have been happy</i>. Every such memory sweetens
after life.</p>
<p>The Bishop did not linger over his meal, and
while servants were clearing away cups and plates,
he said, &#8220;Come, all of you, outside, for a few
minutes. Come and look at the Moon of Moons!
The Easter Moon! She has begun to fill her
horns; and she is throwing over the mystery and
majesty of earth and sea a soft silvery veil as
she watches for the dawn. The Easter dawn!
that in a few hours will come streaming up, full
of light and warmth for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was not much warmth in an Orcadean
April evening and the party soon returned to the
cheerful, comfortable hearth blaze. &#8220;It is not so
beautiful as the moonlight,&#8221; said Rahal, &#8220;but it is
very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said the Bishop, &#8220;and we must not belittle
the good we have, because we look for
something better. Let us be thankful for our
feet, though they are not wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then one of those sudden, inexplicable &#8220;arrests&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
which seem to seal up speech fell over every
one, and for a minute or more no one could speak.
Rahal broke the spell. &#8220;Some angel has passed
through the room. Please God he left a blessing!
Or perhaps the moonlight has thrown a
spell over us. What were you thinking of,
Bishop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you. I was thinking of the first
Good Friday in Old Jerusalem. I was thinking
of the sun hiding his face at noonday. Thora,
have you an almanac?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thora took one from a nail on which it was
hanging and gave it to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking that the sun, which hid his face
at noonday, must at that time have been in Aries,
the Ram. Find me the signs of the Zodiac.&#8221;
Thora did so. &#8220;Now look well at Aries the Ram.
What month of our year is signed thus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The month of March, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know. Tell me, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that in a long forgotten age, some
priest or good man received a promise or prophecy
revealing the Great Sacrifice that would be
offered up for man&#8217;s salvation once and for all
time. And I think they knew that this plenary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
sacrament would occur in the vernal season, in
the month of March, whose sign or symbol was
Aries, the Ram.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why under that sign, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ram, to the ancient world, was the sacrificial
animal. We have only to open our Bibles
and be amazed at the prominence given to the
ram and his congeners. From the time of Abraham
until the time of Christ the ram is constantly
present in sacrificial and religious ceremonies.
Do you remember, Thora, any incident depending
upon a ram?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Isaac was to be sacrificed, a ram caught
in a thicket was accepted by God in Isaac&#8217;s place,
as a burnt offering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than once Abraham offered a ram in
sacrifice. In Exodus, Chapter Twenty-ninth, special
directions are given for the offering of a ram
as a burnt offering to the Lord. In Leviticus, the
Eighth Chapter, a bullock is sacrificed for a sin
offering but a ram for a burnt offering. In Numbers
we are told of <i>the ram of atonement</i> which a
man is to offer, when he has done his neighbour
an injury. In Ezra, the Tenth, the ram is offered
for a trespass because of an unlawful marriage.
On the accession of Solomon to the throne one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
thousand rams with bullocks and lambs were
&#8216;offered up with great gladness.&#8217; In the Old
Testament there are few books in which the sacrificial
ram is not mentioned. Even the horn of
the ram was constantly in evidence, for it called
together all religious and solemn services.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little circumstance,&#8221; continued the Bishop,
&#8220;that pleases me to remember occurred in Glasgow
five weeks ago. I saw a crowd entering a large
church, and I asked a workingman, who was eating
his lunch outside the building, the name of the
church; and he answered,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;It&#8217;s just the auld
Ram&#8217;s Horn Kirk. They are putting a new minister
in the pulpit today and they seem weel
pleased wi&#8217; their choice.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am going to leave this subject with
you. I have only indicated it. Those who wish
to do so, can finish the list, for the half has not
been told, and indeed I have left the most significant
ceremony until the last. It is that wonderful
service in the Sixteenth Chapter of Leviticus,
where the priest, after making a sin offering
of young bullocks and a burnt offering of a ram,
casts lots upon two goats for a sin offering, and
the goat upon which the lot falls is &#8216;presented alive
before the Lord to make an atonement; and to let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he took from his pocket a little book and
said, &#8220;Listen to the end of this service, &#8216;And
Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of
the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities
of the Children of Israel, and all their transgressions
in all their sins, putting them upon the
head of the goat, and shall send him away, by
the hand of a fit man into the wilderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And the goat shall bear upon him all their
iniquities unto a land not inhabited; and he shall
let go the goat in the wilderness.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends, this night let all read the Fifty-third
of Isaiah, and they will understand how fitting
it was that Christ should be &#8216;offered up&#8217; in
Aries the Ram, the sacrificial month representing
the shadows and types of which He was the glorious
arch-type.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was silence, too deeply charged with
feeling, for words. The Bishop himself felt that
he could speak on no lesser subject, and his small
audience were lost in wonder at the vast panorama
of centuries, day by day, century after century,
through all of which God had remembered that
He had promised He would provide the Great
and Final Sacrifice for mankind&#8217;s justification.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Then Aries the Ram would no longer be a promise.
It would be a voucher forever that the
Promise had been redeemed, and a memorial that
His Truth and His mercy endureth forever!</p>
<p>At the door the Bishop said to Ragnor, &#8220;In a
few hours, Friend Conall, it will be Easter
Morning. Then we can tell each other &#8216;<i>Christ has
risen</i>!&#8217;&#8221; And Conall&#8217;s eyes were full of tears,
he could not find his voice, he looked upward and
bowed his head.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">In</span> the meantime Sunna was spending the evening
with her grandfather. The old gentleman
was reading, but she did not ask him to read
aloud, she knew by the look and size of the book
that it would not be interesting; and she was well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
pleased when one of her maids desired to speak
with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Vera, what is thy wish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister was here and she was bringing me
some strange news. About Mistress Brodie she
was talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard she had come home. Did she
bring Thora Ragnor a new Easter gown?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of a gown I heard nothing. It was a young
man she brought! O so beautiful is he! And
like an angel he sings! The Bishop was very
friendly with him, and the Ragnors, also; but they,
indeed! they are friendly with all kinds of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This beautiful young man, is he staying with
the Ragnors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Mistress Brodie he is staying, and with
her he went to dinner at the Ragnors&#8217;. And the
Bishop was there and the young man was singing,
and a great deal was made of his singing, also
they were speaking of his father who is a famous
preacher in some Edinburgh kirk, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These things may be so, but how came thy
sister to know them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning my sister took work with Mistress
Ragnor and she was waiting on them as they
eat; and in and out of the room until nine o&#8217;clock.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Then, as she went to her own home, she called
on me and we talked of the matter, and it seemed
to my thought that more might come of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, no doubt. I shall see that more does
come of it. I am well pleased with thee for telling
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she went back to her grandfather and
resumed her knitting. Anon, she began to sing.
Her face was flushed and her nixie eyes were dancing
to the mischief she contemplated. In a few
minutes the old gentleman lifted his head, and
looked at her. &#8220;Sunna,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thy song and
thy singing are charming, but they fit not the book
I am reading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will stop singing and thou must talk
to me. There has come news, and I want thy
opinion on it. The Ragnors had a dinner party
today, and we were not asked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A great lie is that! Conall Ragnor would not
give Queen Victoria a party in Lent. Who told
thee such foolishness?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Sunna retailed the information given her
and asked, &#8220;What hast thou done to Conall
Ragnor? Always before he bid thee to dinner
when the Bishop was at his house? Or perhaps
the offence is with Rahal Ragnor? Not long ago
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
thou spent an afternoon with her and black
and dangerous as a thunder storm thou came
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This day the dinner was an accidental gathering.
Rahal knows well that I have no will to
dine with Mistress Brodie. Dost thou want her
here, as thy stepmother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mistress Brodie is not tired of an easy life,
she will turn her feet away from this house. If
Sunna cannot please thee, thou art in danger of
worse happening. Yes, many are guessing who
it is thou wilt marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And which way runs the guessing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all one way. For thee, that is not a respectable
thing. Thou should not be named with
so many old women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am of thy opinion. An old woman is little
to my mind. If I trust marriage again, I will
choose a young girl for my wife&ndash;&ndash;such an one as
Treddie Fae, or Thora Ragnor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora Ragnor! Dreaming thou art! I am
sure Barbara Brodie has brought this young man
here for Thora&#8217;s approval. Can thou stand
against a young man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Adam Vedder and fifty thousand pounds
can hand any young man his hat and gloves. Thy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
father&#8217;s father is not for thee to make a jest about.
So here our talk shall come to an end on this
subject. Go to thy bed! Sleep, and the Good
Being bless thee!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna was not yet inclined to sleep. She sat
down before her mirror, uncoiled her plentiful
hair, and carefully brushed and braided it for the
night, as she considered the news that had come
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This beautiful young man, this singing man, is
one of Barbara Brodie&#8217;s &#8216;finds.&#8217; Not much do I
think of any of them! That handsome scholar she
brought here turned out an unbearable encumbrance.
I believe she paid him to go back to Edinburgh.
That Aberdeen man, who wanted to invest
money in Kirkwall had to borrow two pounds from
grandfather to take him back to where he came
from. That witty, good-looking Irishman left a
big bill at the Castle Hotel for some one to pay;
and the woman who wanted to begin a dressmaking
business, on the good will of people like
Barbara Brodie, knew nothing about dressmaking.
This beautiful young man, I&#8217;ll warrant, is a fish
out of the same net. As for the Bishop being
taken with his beauty, that is nothing! The poorer
a man is, the better Bishop Hedley will like him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
So it goes! I wish I knew where Boris Ragnor
is&ndash;&ndash;I wish&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw! I wonder what kind of a dress Mistress
Barbara Brodie brought Thora. Not much
taste in either men or clothes has she! Too large
will the pattern be, or too strong the colours, and
too heavy, or too light, will be the material. I
know! And it will not fit her. Too big, or too
little it is sure to be! With my own dress I am
satisfied. And if grandfather asks no questions
about it, I shall count it a lucky dress and save it
till Boris comes home. I am going to forgive him
when he comes home&ndash;&ndash;perhaps&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Now I will
put the hopes and worries of this world under my
pillow and be off to the Land of Dreams&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Tomorrow
is Sunday, Easter Sunday&ndash;&ndash;I shall
sing the solo in my new dress&ndash;&ndash;that is good, I like
a religious feeling in a new dress&ndash;&ndash;I think I am
rather a religious girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alas for the hopes of all who wanted to dress
for Easter. It was an uncompromising, wet day.
It was oil skin and rubber for the men; it was
cloaks and pattens and umbrellas for the women.
Yet, aside from the rain, it was a day full of good
things. The cathedral was crowded, there was
full cathedral service, and the Bishop preached a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
transfiguring sermon. The music was good, the
home choir did well, and Sunna&#8217;s solo was
effectively sung; but after she had heard Ian
Macrae&#8217;s &#8220;Gloria,&#8221; she was sorry she had sung
at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather!&#8221; she commented, &#8220;No private
person has a right to sing as that man sings!
After him, non-professionals make a show of
themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou sang well&ndash;&ndash;better than usual, I
thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told he was such a handsome young
man! And he has black hair and black eyes!
Even his skin is dark. He looks like a Celt. I
don&#8217;t like Celts. None of our people like them.
When they come to the fishing they are not respected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art much mistaken. Our men like
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris Ragnor says they are poor traders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, it is to fish they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What they come for is no care of mine. Boris
is ten times more of a man than the best of them.
No notice shall I take of this Celt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through thy scorn he may live, and even enjoy
his life. The English officers do that.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&#8220;This chicken is better than might be. Wilt
thou have a little more of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough is plenty. I have had enough. At
Conall Ragnor&#8217;s there is always good eating and
I am going there for my supper. Wilt thou go
with me? Then with Thora thou can talk. This
beautiful young man is likely at Ragnor&#8217;s. It was
too stormy for Mistress Brodie to go to her own
house at the noonday. Dost thou see then, how it
will be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go with thee, I want to see Thora&#8217;s new
dress. I need not notice the young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His name? Already I have forgotten it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd was calling him &#8216;Macrae.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Macrae! That is Highland Scotch. The
Macraes are a good family. There is a famous
minister in Edinburgh of that name. The Calvinists
all swear by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This man sang in a full cathedral service.
Dost thou believe a Calvinist would do that? He
would be sure it was a disguised mass, and nothing
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adam laughed as he said, &#8220;Well, then, go with
me this night to Ragnor&#8217;s and between us we will
find something out. A mystery is not pleasant to
thee.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There is something wrong in a mystery, that is
what I feel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou can ask Thora all about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not ask her. She will tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adam laughed again. &#8220;That is the best way,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It was thy father&#8217;s way. Well then,
five minutes ago, the wind changed. By four
o&#8217;clock it will be fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will be ready to go with thee. If I
am left alone, I am sad; and that is not good for
my health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But thou must behave well, even to the Celt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless it is worth my while, I do not quarrel
with any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it worth thy while to quarrel with Boris
Ragnor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;or I had not quarrelled with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes the sunshine! Gleam upon
gloom! Cheery and good it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They say an Easter dress should be christened
with a few drops of rain. That is not my opinion.
I like the Easter sunshine on it. Now I shall
leave thee and go and rest and dress myself. Very
good is thy talk and thy company to me, but to
thee, I am foolishness. As I shut the door, the
big book thou art reading, thou wilt say to it:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
&#8216;Now, friend of my soul, some sensible talk we
will have together, for that foolish girl has gone
to her foolishness at her looking glass.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run away! I am in a hurry for my big
book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna shut the door with a kiss&ndash;&ndash;and as she
took the stairs with hurrying steps, the sunshine
came dancing through the long window, and her
feet trod on it and it fell all over her.</p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock she was ready for her evening&#8217;s
inquest and she found her grandfather waiting
for her. He had put on a light vest and a white
tie, and he had that clean, healthy, good-tempered
look that pleases all women. He smiled and
bowed to Sunna and she deserved the compliment;
for she was beautiful and had dressed her beauty
most becomingly. Her gown was of Saxony cloth,
the exact colour of her hair, with a collar, stomacher
and high cuffs of pale green velvet. The
collar was tied with cord and small tassels of gold
braid; the stomacher laced with gold braid over
small gilt buttons, and the high cuffs were trimmed
to match. Very handsome gilt combs held up her
rippled hair, and a large red-riding-hood cloak
covered her from the crowning bow of her hair to
the little French pattens that protected her black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
satin slippers. She expected to make a conquest,
and her thoughts were usually the factors of
success.</p>
<p>A little disappointment awaited her. She was
usually shown into the right-hand parlour at once,
and she relied on the bit of colour afforded by her
scarlet cloak to give life to the modest shades of
her spring colours of pale fawn and tender green.
But servants were setting the dinner table in the
right-hand parlour; and Conall and Rahal and
Aunt Barbara had taken themselves to Conall&#8217;s
little business room where there was a bright fire
burning. There, in his big chair, Conall was next
door to sleeping; and Barbara and Rahal
were talking in a sleepy, mysterious way about
something that did not appear to interest
them.</p>
<p>At the sound of Adam Vedder&#8217;s voice, Conall
became wide awake; and Barbara&#8217;s face lighted
up with a fresh interest. If there was nothing else,
there was a chronic quarrel between them, which
Barbara was ready to lift at a moment&#8217;s notice.
But Sunna was not dissatisfied. Conall&#8217;s quick
look of admiration, and Rahal&#8217;s and Barbara&#8217;s
glances of surprise, were excellent in their way.
She knew she had given them a subject of interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
sufficient to make even the hour before dinner
appear short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Thora?&#8221; she asked, as she turned
every way, apparently to look for Thora, but
really to allow her admirers to convince themselves
that her dress was trimmed as handsomely
at the back as the front&ndash;&ndash;that if the stomacher
was perfect in front, the sash of green velvet at
the back was quite as stylish and elaborate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where <i>is</i> Thora?&#8221; she asked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the drawing room thou wilt find Thora with
Ian Macrae,&#8221; said Rahal. &#8220;Go to them. They
will be glad of thy company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtful is their gladness. Two are company,
three are a crowd. Yet so it is! I must run into
danger, like the rest of women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that thy Easter gown, Sunna?&#8221; asked Mistress
Brodie.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is. Dost thou like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would not like it? The rumour goes
abroad that thy grandfather sent to Inverness
for it. Others say it came to thee from Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong are both stories. I am happy to say
that Sunna Vedder gave herself a dress so pretty
and so suitable.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>With these smiling words she left the room and
the elder women shrugged their shoulders and
looked expressively at each other. &#8220;What can a
sensible man like Boris Ragnor see in such a
harum-scarum girl!&#8221; was Rahal Ragnor&#8217;s question,
and Barbara Brodie thought it was all Adam
Vedder&#8217;s fault. &#8220;He ought to have married some
sensible woman who would have brought up the
girl as girls ought to be brought up,&#8221; she answered;
adding, &#8220;We may as well remember that
the management of women, at any age, is a
business clean beyond Adam Vedder&#8217;s capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam is a clever man, Barbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Book clever! What is the use of book wisdom
when you have a live girl, full of her own
way, to deal with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conall chose the husbands for his daughters.
They were quite suitable to the girls and they have
been very happy with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora will choose for herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, that may be so. Thora has been
spoiled. Her marriage need not yet be thought
of. In two or three years, we will consider it.
The little one has not yet any dreams of that
kind.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Such dreams come in a moment&ndash;&ndash;when you
are not thinking of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, at that very moment Thora was learning
the mystery of &#8220;falling in love&#8221;; and there is
hardly a more vital thing in life than this act.
For it is something taking place in the subconscious
self; it is a revolution, and a growth. It
happened that after dinner, Conall wished to hear
Ian sing again that loveliest of all metrical Collects,
&#8220;Lord of All Power and Might,&#8221; and Thora
went with Ian to do her part as accompanist on
the piano. As they sang Conall appeared to fall
asleep, and no more music was asked for.</p>
<p>Then Ian lifted a book full of illustrations of
the English lake district, and they sat down on the
sofa to examine it. Ian had once been at Keswick
and Ambleside, and he began to tell her about
Lake Windemere and these lovely villages. He
was holding Thora&#8217;s hand and glancing constantly
into her face, and before he recognised what he
was saying, Ambleside and Windemere were quite
forgotten, and he was telling Thora that he loved
her with an everlasting love. He vowed that he
had loved her in his past lives, and would love her,
and only her, forever. And he looked so handsome
and spoke in words of the sweetest tenderness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
and indeed was amazed at his own passionate
eloquence, but knew in his soul that every word he
said was true.</p>
<p>And Thora, the innocent little one, was equally
sure of his truth. She blushed and listened, while
he drew her closer to his side calling her &#8220;his own,
his very own!&#8221; and begging her to promise that
she would &#8220;marry him, and no other man, in the
whole earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Thora promised him what he wished and
for one-half hour they were in Paradise.</p>
<p>Now, how could this love affair have come to
perfection so rapidly? Because it was the natural
and the proper way. True love dates its birth
from the first glance. It is the coming together
of two souls, and in their first contact love flashes
forth like flame. And then their influence over
each other is like that gravitation which one star
exerts over another star.</p>
<p>But much that passes for love is not love. It is
only a prepossession, pleasant and profitable,
promising many every-day advantages. True love
is a deep and elemental thing, a secret incredible
glory, in a way, it is even a spiritual triumph.
And we should have another name for love like
this. For it is the long, long love, that has followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
us through ages, the healing love, the Comforter!
In the soul of a young, innocent girl like
Thora, it is a kind of piety, and ought to be taken
with a wondering thankfulness.</p>
<p>An emotion so spiritual and profound was
beyond Sunna&#8217;s understanding. She divined that
there had been some sort of love-making, but she
was unfamiliar with its present indications. Her
opinion, however, was that Ian had offered himself
to Thora, and been rejected; in no other way
could she account for the far-offness of both parties.
Thora indeed was inexplicable. She not only
refused to show Sunna her Easter dress, she would
not enter into any description of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a very remarkable thing,&#8221; she said to
her grandfather, as they walked home together.
&#8220;I think the young man made love to Thora and
even asked her to marry him, and Thora was
frightened and said &#8216;No!&#8217; and she is likely sorry
now that she did not say &#8216;Yes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To say &#8216;No!&#8217; would not have frightened thee,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one of the disagreeable things women
have to get used to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How often must a woman say &#8216;No!&#8217; in order
to get used to it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That depends on several small things; for instance
I am very sympathetic. I have a tender
heart! Yes, and so I suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to know of thy sympathy. If I
asked thee to marry a young man whom I wished
thee to marry, would thou do it&ndash;&ndash;just to please
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would depend&ndash;&ndash;on my mood that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, it was thy sympathetic mood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be unfavourable. Of the others
I should think, and I should feel that I was cruel;
if I took all hope from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt not be reasonable. I am not joking.
Would thou marry Boris to please me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris has offended me. He must come to me,
and say, &#8216;I am sorry.&#8217; He must take what punishment
I choose for his rudeness to me. Then, I
may forgive him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And marry him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only my angel knows, if it is so written. Men
do not like to do as their women say they must
do. Is there any man in the Orcades who dares
to say &#8216;No,&#8217; to his wife&#8217;s &#8216;Yes?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of Sandy Stark?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandy is a Scot! I do not use a Scotch measure
for a Norseman. Thou art not a perfect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Norseman, but yet, even in Edinburgh, there is
no Scot that could be thy measure. I should have
to say&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;thou art five inches taller than the Scot
at thy side, and forty pounds heavier, and nearly
twice as strong.&#8217; That would not be correct to
an ounce, but it is as near as it is possible to come
between Norse and Scot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art romancing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the Norse women&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About Norse women there is no need for thee
to teach thy grandfather. I know what Norse
women are like. If I did not know, I should have
married again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Barbara Brodie is a good specimen
of a capable Norse woman and I have noticed one
thing about them, that I feel ought to be better
understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chut! What hast thou understood? Talk
about it, and let thy wisdom be known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, it is this thing&ndash;&ndash;Norse women
always outlive their husbands. Thou may count
by tens and hundreds the widows in this town.
The &#8216;maidens of blushing fifteen&#8217; have no opportunities;
the widow of fifty asks a young man into
her beautiful home and makes him acquainted
with the burden of her rents and dividends and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
her share in half a dozen trading boats, and he
takes to the golden lure and marries himself like
the rest of the world. Thou would have been
re-married long ago but for my protection. I
have had a very disagreeable day and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go to thy bed and put an end to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My new dress is crushed and some way or
other I have got a spot on the front breadth. Is
it that Darwin book thou art looking for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would thou like to read a chapter to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I would not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather, I can understand it. I like clever
men. Can thou introduce me to him&ndash;&ndash;to Darwin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would not care to see thee. Clever men
do not want clever wives; so if thou art thinking
of a clever husband keep thy &#8216;blue stockings&#8217; well
under thy petticoats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And grandfather, do thou keep out of the way
of the widows of Orkney or thou wilt find thyself
inside of a marriage ring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not while thou remains unmarried. Few
women would care to look after thy welfare. I
am used to it, long before thou had been short-coated,
I had to walk thee to sleep in my arms.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Sunna, &#8220;I remember that. I
felt myself safest with thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou remembers nothing of the kind. At six
months old, thou could neither compare nor
remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But thou art mistaken. I was born with perfect
senses. Ere I was twenty-four hours old, I
had selected thee as the most suitable person to
walk me to sleep. I think that was a proof of my
perfect intelligence. One thing more, and then I
will let thee read. I am going to marry Boris
Ragnor, and then the widow Brodie would&ndash;&ndash;take
charge of thee.&#8221; She shut the door to these words
and Adam heard her laughing all the way to her
own room. Then he rubbed his hand slowly over
and over his mouth and said to himself&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;She
shall have her say-so; Boris is the only man on
the Islands who can manage her.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the departure of the Vedders, Rahal and
her sister Brodie went upstairs, taking Thora with
them. She went cheerfully though a little reluctantly.
She liked to hear Ian talk. She had
thought of asking him to sing; but she was satisfied
with the one straight, long look which flashed
between them, as Ian bid her &#8220;good night&#8221;;
for&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
<p class='cg'>He looked at her as a lover can;<br />
She looked at him as one who awakes,<br />
The past was a sleep and her life began.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Then she went to her room, and thought of Ian
until she fell asleep and dreamed of him.</p>
<p>For nearly two hours Ian remained with Conall
Ragnor. The Railway Mania was then at its
height in England, and the older man was delighted
with Ian&#8217;s daring stories of its mad excitement.
Ian had seen and talked with Hudson, the
draper&#8217;s clerk, who had just purchased a fine ducal
residence and estate from the results of his reckless
speculations. Ian knew all the Scotch lines, he
had even full faith in the <i>Caledonian</i> when it was
first proposed and could hardly win any attention.
&#8220;Every one said a railway between England and
Scotland would not pay, Mr. Ragnor,&#8221; said Ian.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have said very different,&#8221; replied
Conall. &#8220;It would be certain to pay. Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there would be <i>no returns</i>,&#8221; laughed
Ian, and then Conall laughed also, and wished that
Boris had been there to learn whatever Ian might
teach him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hast thou speculated in railway stock yet,&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I have not had the money to do so.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How would thou buy if thou had?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would buy when no one else was buying, and
when everyone else was buying, I would keep cool,
and sell. A very old and clever speculator gave
me that advice as a steady rule, saying it was &#8216;his
only guide.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the tenor of the men&#8217;s conversation
until near midnight, and then Ragnor went with
Ian to the door of his room and bid him a frank
and friendly good night. And as he stood a moment
handfast with the youth, his conscience troubled
him a little and he said: &#8220;Ian, Ian, thou art a
wise lad about this world&#8217;s business, but thou must
not be forgetting that there is another world after
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not forget that, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bishop Hedley is a greater and wiser man
than all the railway nabobs thou hast spoken of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, sir! I do indeed!&#8221; and the mutual
smile and nod that followed required no further
&#8220;good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a lovely, silent night. The very houses
looked as if they were asleep; and there was not
a sound either in the town on the brown pier or
the moonlit sea. It was a night full of the tranquillity
of God. Men and women looked into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
its peace, and carried its charm into their dreams.
For most fine spirits that dwell by the sea have an
elemental sympathy with strange oracles and
dreams and old Night. In the morning, Conall
Ragnor was the first to awaken. He went at
once to fling open his window. Then he cried
out in amazement and wonder, and awakened his
wife:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rahal! Rahal!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Come here!
Come quick! Look at the town! It is hung with
flags. The ships in the harbour&ndash;&ndash;flying are their
flags also! And there is a ship just entering the
harbour and her colours are flying! And there
are the guns! They are saluting her from the
garrison! It must be a man-of-war! I wonder
if the Queen is coming to see us at last! If thou
art ready, call Thora and Barbara. Something
is up! Thou may hear the town now, all tip-on-top
with excitement!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did not thou call us sooner, Coll?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I slept late and long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But thou must have heard the town noises?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A confused noise passed through my ears, a
noise full of hurry like a morning dream, that was
all. Now, I am going for my swim and I will
bring the news home with me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>But long before it was within expectation of
Ragnor&#8217;s return, the three women standing at the
open door saw Ian coming rapidly to the house
from the town. His walk was swift and full of
excitement. His head was thrown upward, and
he kept striking himself on the right side, just over
the place where his ancestors had worn their dirks
or broadswords. As soon as he saw the three
women he flung his Glengarry skyward and
shouted a ringing &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he approached them, all were struck with
his remarkable beauty, his manly figure, his swift
graceful movements and his handsome face suffused
with the brightness of fiery youth. Through
their long black lashes his eyes were shining and
glowing and full of spirit, and indeed his whole
personality was instinct with verve and fire. Anyone
watching his approach would have said&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Here
comes a youth made to lead a rattling
charge of cavalry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever is the matter with you, Ian?&#8221;
cried Mistress Brodie. &#8220;You are surely gone
daft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I seem at this
very hour to have just found myself and my
senses.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What is all the fuss about, Ian?&#8221; asked
Rahal.</p>
<p>&#8220;England has gone to war at the long last with
the cruel, crafty black Bear of the North.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, it is full time she did so, there are
none will say different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; continued Ian, &#8220;there is a ship now in
harbour carrying enlisting officers&ndash;&ndash;you may see
her; she is to call at the Orkney and Shetland
Islands for recruits for the navy, and Great Scot!
she will get them! All she wants! She could take
every man out of Kirkwall!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mayor and Captain Ragnor will not permit
her to do so. She will have to leave men to
manage the fishing,&#8221; said Rahal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought the women could do that,&#8221; said Ian.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know what you are talking about.
It takes two or three men to lift a net full of fish
out of the water, and they are about done up if
they manage it. Come in and get your breakfast.
If your news be true, there is no saying when
Ragnor will get home. He will have some reasoning
with his men to do, he cannot spare many of
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a good idea,&#8221; said Mistress Brodie.
&#8220;I will give a dance on Friday night for the enlisting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
officers, and we will invite all the presentable
young men, and all the prettiest girls, to
meet them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will be too late on Friday. The
cutter and her crew will leave Thursday morning
early,&#8221; said Ian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then say Wednesday night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might do. I could tell the men freshly
enlisted to wear a white ribbon in their coats&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; cried Rahal. &#8220;What are you
saying, Ian? A white favour is a Stuart favour.
You would set the men fighting in the very dance
room. There is no excuse in the Orkneys for a
Stuart memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not thinking of the Stuarts. Have they
not done bothering yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Scotch heart the Stuart lives forever,&#8221;
said Rahal, with a sigh.</p>
<p>But the dance was decided on and some preparations
made for it as soon as breakfast was over.
Ian was enthusiastic on the matter and Thora
caught his enthusiasm very readily, and before
night, all Kirkwall was preparing to feast and
rejoice because England was going to make the
great Northern Bear&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;the Bear that walks like
a man&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;stay in the North where he belonged.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">No</span> sooner was Mrs. Brodie&#8217;s intention known,
than all her friends were eager to help her.
There was truly but little time between Monday
morning and Wednesday night; but many hands
make light work, and old and young offered their
services in arranging for what it pleased all to
consider as a kind of national thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The unanimity of this kindness gave Rahal a
slight attack of a certain form of jealousy, to
which she had been subject for many years, and
she asked her husband, as she had done often
before, &#8220;Why is it, Coll, that every woman in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
town is eager to help and encourage Barbara if
she only speaks of having a dance or dinner; but
if I, thy wife, am the giver of pleasure, I am
left to do all without help or any show of interest.
It troubles me, Coll.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Coll answered as he always did answer&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;It
is thy superiority, Rahal. Is there any woman
we know, who would presume to give thee advice
or counsel? And it is well understood by all of
them that thou cannot thole an obligation. Thou,
and thy daughter, and thy servants are sufficient
for all thy social plans; and why should thou be
bothered with a lot of old and young women?
Thy sister Brodie loves a crowd about her, and
she says &#8216;thank thee&#8217; to all and sundry, as easily
as she takes a drink of water. It chokes thee to
say &#8216;thanks&#8217; to any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Rahal was satisfied, and went with the rest
to help Mistress Brodie prepare for her dance.
There were women in the kitchen making pies and
custards and jellies, and women in her parlours
cleaning and decorating them, and women in the
great hall taking up carpets because it was a favourite
place for reels, and women washing China
and trimming lamps. Thora was doing the shopping,
Ian was carrying the invitations; and every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
one who had been favoured with one had not only
said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; but had also asked if there was anything
they could loan, or do, to help the impromptu
festival. Thus, Mrs. Harold Baikie sent her best
service of China, and the Faes sent several extra
large lamps, and the bride of Luke Serge loaned
her whole supply of glassware, and Rahal took
over her stock of table silver; and Mistress
Brodie received every loan&ndash;&ndash;useful or not&ndash;&ndash;with
the utmost delight and satisfaction.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, however, she was
faced by a condition she did not know how to
manage. Ian came to her in a hurry, saying,
&#8220;My friend, McLeod, is longing for an invitation
from you, and he has asked me to request one.
Surely you will send him the favour! Yes, I
know you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are knowing too much, Ian. What can I
do? You know well, laddie, he is not popular
with the best set here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not mind the &#8216;best set&#8217; if I were you.
What makes them &#8216;the best&#8217;? Just their own
opinion of themselves. McLeod is of gentle
birth, he is handsome and good-hearted, you will
like him as soon as you speak to him. There is
another &#8216;best set&#8217; beside the one Adam Vedder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
leads; I would like some one to take down that
old man&#8217;s conceit of himself&ndash;&ndash;there is nothing
wrong with McLeod! Yes, he is Highland
Scotch&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There! that is enough, Ian! Go your ways
and bid the young man. Ask him in your own
name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mistress, I will not do that. The invitation
carries neither honour nor good will without
your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, my name be it. My name has been
so much used lately, I think I will change it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take my name then. I will be proud indeed
if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are aye daffing, Ian; I am o&#8217;er busy for
nonsense the now. Give the Mac a hint that tartans
are not necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I cannot do that. I am going to wear the
Macrae tartan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can let that intent go by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can not! A certain &#8216;yes&#8217; may depend
on my wearing the Macrae tartan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, checked cloth is bonnier than black
broadcloth to some people. I don&#8217;t think Thora
Ragnor is among that silly crowd. There is not
a more quarrelsome dress than a tartan kilt&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
I&#8217;m thinking the Brodies were ill friends with the
Macraes in the old days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Brodies are not Highlanders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a shamefully ignorant man, Ian
Macrae. The Brodies came from Moray, and
are the only true lineal descendants of Malcolm
Thane of Brodie in the reign of Alexander the
Third, lawful King of Scotland. What do you
think of the Brodies now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Macrae doffs his bonnet to them;
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you say another word, the McLeod will be
out of it&ndash;&ndash;sure and final.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Ian laughingly left the room, and Mistress
Brodie walked to the window and watched him
speeding towards the town. &#8220;He is a wonderful
lad!&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;And I wish he was
my lad! Oh why were all my bairns lasses? They
just married common bodies and left me! Oh for
a lad like Ian Macrae!&#8221; Then with a great sigh,
she added: &#8220;It is all right. I would doubtless
have spoiled and mismanaged him!&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that Sunna Vedder kept
away from all this social stir and preparation.
She was first and foremost in everything during
Monday and Tuesday, but Wednesday she reserved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
herself altogether for the evening. No
one saw her until the noon hour; then she came to
the dinner table, for she had an entirely fresh
request to make, one which she was sure would
require all her personal influence to compass.</p>
<p>She prefaced it with the intelligence that Boris
had arrived during the night, and that Elga had
met him in the street&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;looking more handsome
than any man ought to look, except upon his
wedding day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And on that day,&#8221; said Adam, gloomily, &#8220;a
man has generally good cause to look ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he was going to marry me, Grandfather,
how then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would doubtless look handsome. Men
usually do when they are on the road of destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather! I have made up my mind to
marry Boris, and lead him the way I want him to
go. That will always be the way thou chooseth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How comes that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved thee first of all. I shall always love
thee first. Boris played me false, I must pay him
back. I must make him suffer. Those Ragnors&ndash;&ndash;all
of them&ndash;&ndash;put on such airs! They make me
sick.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What art thou after? What favour art thou
seeking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou knows how the girls will try to outdress
each other at this Brodie affair&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too late for a new dress&ndash;&ndash;what is it thou
wants now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want thee to go to the bank and get me my
mother&#8217;s necklace to wear just this one night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not. I gave thy dead mother a
promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Break it, for a few hours. My Easter dress
is not a dancing dress. I have no dancing dress
but the pretty white silk thou gave me last Christmas&ndash;&ndash;and
I have no ornaments at all&ndash;&ndash;none whatever,
fit to wear with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are always flowers&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flowers! There is not a flower in Kirkwall.
Easter and old Mistress Brodie have used up
every daisy&ndash;&ndash;besides, white silk ought to have
jewels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adam shook his head positively.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother wishes me to have what I want.
Thou ought not to keep it from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me to give thee her necklace on thy
twenty-first birthday&ndash;&ndash;not before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so silly! What better is my twenty-first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
birthday than any other day? Grandfather,
I cannot love thee more, because my love for thee
is already a perfect love; but I will be such a good
girl if thou wilt give me what I want, O so much
I want it! I will be so obedient! I will do everything
thou desires! I will even marry Boris
Ragnor.&#8221; And this urgent request was punctuated
with kisses and little fondling strokes of her
hand, and Adam finally asked&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;How shall I answer thy mother when she
accuses me of breaking my promise to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will answer for thee. O dear! It is growing
late! If thou dost not hurry, the bank will
be closed, and then I shall be sick with disappointment,
and it will be thy fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Adam rose and left the house and Sunna,
having seen that he took the proper turn in the
road, called for a cup of tea and having refreshed
herself with it, went upstairs to lay out and prepare
everything for her toilet. And as she went
about this business she continually justified herself:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only natural I should have my necklace,&#8221;
she thought. &#8220;Norse women have always adored
gold and silver and gems, and in the old days
their husbands sailed long journeys and fought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
battles for what their women wanted. My great
Aunt Christabelle often told me that many of the
old Shetland and Orkney families had gold ornaments
and uncut gems, hundreds of years old, hid
away. I would not wonder if Grandfather has
some! I dare say the bank&#8217;s safe is full of them!
I do not care for them but I do want my mother&#8217;s
wedding necklace&ndash;&ndash;and I am going to have it.
Right and proper it is, I should have it now.
Mother would say so if she were here. Girls are
women earlier than they were in her day. Twenty-one,
indeed! I expect to be married long before
I am twenty-one.&#8221;</p>
<p>In less than an hour she began to watch the road
for her grandfather&#8217;s return. Very soon she saw
him coming and he had a small parcel in his hand.
Her heart gave a throb of satisfaction and she
began to unplait her manifold small braids: &#8220;I
shall not require to go to bed,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Grandfather has my necklace. He will want to
take it back to the bank tomorrow&ndash;&ndash;I shall see
about that&ndash;&ndash;I promised&ndash;&ndash;yes, I know! But there
are ways&ndash;&ndash;out of a promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was, of course, delightfully grateful to
receive the necklace, and Vedder could not help
noticing how beautiful her loosened hair looked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Its length and thickness and waves of light colour
gave to her stately, blonde beauty a magical grace,
and Vedder was one of those men who admire
the charms of his own family as something naturally
greater than the same charms in any other
family. &#8220;The Vedders carry their beauty with an
air,&#8221; he said, and he was right. The Vedders
during the course of a few centuries of social
prominence had acquired that air of superiority
which impresses, and also frequently
offends.</p>
<p>Certainly, Sunna Vedder in white silk and a
handsome necklace of rubies and diamonds was
an imposing picture; and Adam Vedder, in spite
of his sixty-two years, was an imposing escort. It
would be difficult to say why, for he was a small
man in comparison with the towering Norsemen
by whom he was surrounded. Yet he dominated
and directed any company he chose to favour with
his presence; and every man in Kirkwall either
feared or honoured him. Sunna had much of his
natural temperament, but she had not the driving
power of his cultivated intellect. She relied on
her personal beauty and the many natural arts
with which Nature has made women a match for
any antagonist. Had she not heard her grandfather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
frequently say &#8220;a beautiful woman is the
best armed creature that God has made! She is
as invincible as a rhinoceros!&#8221;</p>
<p>This night he had paid great attention to his
own toilet. He was fashionably attired, neat as
a new pin, and if not amiable, at least exceedingly
polite. He had leaning on his arm what he considered
the most beautiful creature in Scotland,
and he assumed the manners of her guardian with
punctilious courtesy.</p>
<p>There was a large company present when the
Vedders reached Mrs. Brodie&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;military men, a
couple of naval officers, gentlemen of influence,
and traders of wealth and enterprise; with a full
complement of women &#8220;divinely tall and fair.&#8221;
Sunna made the sensation among them she expected
to make. There was a sudden pause in
conversation and every eye filled itself with her
beauty. For just a moment, it seemed as if there
was no other person present.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Brodie and Colonel Belton came to
meet them, and Sunna was left in the latter&#8217;s
charge. &#8220;Will you now dance, Miss Vedder?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us first walk about a little, Colonel. I
want to find my friend, Thora Ragnor.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have long desired an introduction to Miss
Ragnor. Is she not lovely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but now only for one man. A stranger
came here last week, and she was captured at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How remarkable! I thought that kind of
irresponsible love had gone quite out of favour and
fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so! This youth came, saw, and conquered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it the youth I see with Ken McLeod?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same. Look! There they are, together
as usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very sweet and attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna answered this remark by asking Thora
to honour Colonel Belton with her company for a
short time, saying: &#8220;In the interval I will take
care of Ian Macrae.&#8221; Then Thora stood up in
her innocence and loveliness and she was like some
creature of more ethereal nature than goes with
flesh and blood. For the eye took her in as a
whole, and at first noticed neither her face nor
her dress in particular. Her dress was only of
white tarlatan, a thin, gauze-like material long out
of fashion. It is doubtful if any woman yet remembers
its airy, fairy sway, and graceful folds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
The filmy robe, however, was plentifully trimmed
with white satin ribbon, and the waist was entirely
of satin trimmed with tarlatan. The whole effect
was girlish and simple, and Thora needed no other
ornament but the pink and white daisies at her
belt.</p>
<p>However, if Sunna expected Thora&#8217;s manner
and conversation to match the simplicity of her
dress, she was disappointed. In Love&#8217;s school
women learn with marvellous rapidity, and Thora
astonished her by falling readily into a conversation
of the most up-to-date social character. She
had caught the trick from Ian, a little playful fencing
round the most alluring of subjects, yet it
brought out the simplicity of her character, while
it also revealed its purity and intelligence.</p>
<p>Dancing had commenced when Mrs. Ragnor
entered the room on the arm of her son Boris.
Boris instantly looked around for Sunna and she
was dancing with McLeod. All the evening afterwards
Boris danced, but never once with Sunna,
and Adam Vedder watched the young man with
scorn. He was the most desirable party in the
room for any girl and he quite neglected the handsome
Sunna Vedder. That was not his only annoyance.
McLeod was dancing far too often with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Sunna, and even the beautiful youth Ian Macrae
had only asked her hand once; and Adam was
sure that Thora Ragnor had been the suggester of
that act of politeness. Girls far inferior to Sunna
in every respect had received more attention than
his granddaughter. He was greatly offended, but
he appeared to turn his back on the whole affair
and to be entirely occupied in conversation with
Conall Ragnor and Colonel Belton concerning the
war with Russia.</p>
<p>Every way the evening was to Sunna a great disappointment,
in many respects she felt it to be a
great humiliation; and the latter feeling troubled
her more for her grandfather than for herself.
She knew he was mortified, for he did not speak to
her as they walked through the chill, damp midnight
to their home. Mrs. Brodie had urged
Adam and Sunna to put the night past at her
house, but Adam had been proof against all her
suggestions, and even against his own desires. So
he satisfied his temper by walking home and insisting
on Sunna doing likewise.</p>
<p>It was a silent, unhappy walk. Adam said not
a word to Sunna and she would not open the way
for his anger to relieve itself. When they reached
home they found a good fire in the room full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
books which Adam called his own, and there they
went. Then Sunna let her long dress fall down,
and put out her sandalled feet to the warmth of
the fire. Adam glanced into her face and saw that
it was full of trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to thy bed, Sunna,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of this
night thou must have had enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had too much, by far. If only thou
loved me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else do I love? There is none but thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then with some one thou ought to be angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it with Boris Ragnor I should be angry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! It is with Boris Ragnor. Not once did
he ask me to dance. Watching him and me were
all the girls. They saw how he slighted me, and
made little nods and laughs about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was thy own fault. When Boris came into
the room, he looked for thee. With McLeod
thou wert dancing. With that Scot thou wert
dancing! The black look on his face, I saw it,
thou should have seen it and have given him a
smile&ndash;&ndash;Pshaw! Women know so much&ndash;&ndash;and do
so little. By storm thou ought to have taken the
whole affair for thy own. I am disappointed in
thee&ndash;&ndash;yes, I am disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Grandfather?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&#8220;An emergency thou had to face, and thou
shirked it. When Boris entered the room, straight
up to him thou should have gone; with an outstretched
hand and a glad smile thou should have
said: &#8216;I am waiting for thee, Boris!&#8217; Then thou
had put all straight that was crooked, and carried
the evening in thy own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will pay Boris for this insult. Yes, I will,
and thou must help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To quarrel with Boris? To injure him in
any way? No! that I will not do. It would be to
quarrel also with my old friend Conall. Not thee!
Not man or woman living, could make me do
that! Sit down and I will tell thee a better way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will not sit down till thou say &#8216;yes&#8217; to
what I ask&#8221;; for some womanly instinct told her
that while Adam was cowering over the hearth
blaze and she stood in all her beauty and splendour
above him, she controlled the situation. &#8220;Thou
must help me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To what or whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to marry Boris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou love him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than might be. When mine he is all
mine, then I will love him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is little to trust to.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thou art wrong. It is of reasons one of the
best and surest. Not three months ago, a little
dog followed thee home, an ugly, half-starved little
mongrel, not worth a shilling; but it was determined
to have thee for its master, and thou called
it thy dog, and now it is petted and pampered and
lies at thy feet, and barks at every other dog, and
thou says it is the best dog on the Island. It is
the same way with husbands. Thou hast seen how
Mary Minorie goes on about her bald, scrimpy
husband; yet she burst out crying when he put the
ring on her finger. Now she tells all the girls
that marriage is &#8216;Paradise Regained.&#8217; When
Boris is my husband it will be well with me, and
not bad for him. He will be mine, and we love
what is our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wilt thou marry any man? Thou wilt be
rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One must do as the rest of the world does&ndash;&ndash;and
the world has the fashion of marrying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money rules love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Bolon Flett had only scorn for his poor
little wife until her uncle left her two thousand
pounds. Since then, no word is long enough or
good enough for her excellencies. Money opens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
the eyes as well as the heart. What then, if I
make Boris rich?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris is too proud to take money from thee
and I will not be sold to any man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou wait until my meaning is given thee&ndash;&ndash;flying
off in a temper like a foolish woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry&ndash;&ndash;speak thy meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down. Thou art not begging anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not from thee. I have thy love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thine is mine. This is my plan. Above
all things Boris loves a stirring, money-making
business. I am going to ask him to take me as
his partner. Tired am I of living on my past.
How many boats has Boris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou knowest he has but one, but she is large
and swift, and does as much business as McLeod&#8217;s
three little sloops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Schooners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Schooners, then&ndash;&ndash;little ones!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, there is a new kind of boat which
thou hast never seen. She is driven by steam, not
wind, she goes swiftly, all winds are fair to her,
and she cares little for storms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a ship like that when I was in Edinburgh.
She lay in Leith harbour, and the whole
school went to Leith to see her come in.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If Boris will be my partner, I will lay my luck
to his, and I will buy a steam ship, a large coaster&ndash;&ndash;dost
thou see?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then with a laugh she cried: &#8220;I see, I see!
Then thou can easily beat the sloops or schooners,
that have nothing but sails. Good is that, very
good!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. We can make two trips for their one.
No one can trade against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McLeod may buy steam ships.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learned all about him. His fortune is
in real estate, mostly in Edinburgh. It takes a
lifetime to sell property in Edinburgh. We shall
have got all there is to get before McLeod could
compete with Vedder and Ragnor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That scheme would please Boris, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A boat could be built on the Clyde in about
four months, I think. Shall I speak to Boris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Boris will not fly in the face of good fortune;
but mind this&ndash;&ndash;it is easier to begin that reel
than it will be to end it. One thing I do not like&ndash;&ndash;thou
wert angry with Boris, now thou wilt take
him for a partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At any time I can put my anger under my purse&ndash;&ndash;but
my anger was mostly against thee. Now
shall I do as I am minded?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That way is more likely than not! I think
this affair will grow with thee&ndash;&ndash;but thou may
change thy mind&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not call my words back. Go now to thy
bed and forget everything. This is the time when
sleep will be better than either words or deeds.
Of my intent speak to <i>no one</i>. In thy thoughts let
it be still until its hour arrives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning, very early, I am going to see
Thora. When the enlisting ship sails northward,
there will be a crowd to see her off. Boris and
Thora and Macrae will be among it. I also intend
to be there. Dost thou know at what hour
she will leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At ten o&#8217;clock the tide is full.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then at ten, she will sail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely enough, is that. Our talk is now ended.
Let it be, as if it had not been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have forgotten it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vedder laughed, and added: &#8220;Go then to thy
bed, I am tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not tired of Sunna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, yes, of thee I have had enough at
present.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went away as he spoke, and then he was
worried. &#8220;Now I am unhappy!&#8221; he ejaculated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
&#8220;What provokers to the wrong way are women!
Her mother was like her&ndash;&ndash;my beloved Adriana!&#8221;
And his old eyes filled with sorrowful tears as he
recalled the daughter he had lost in the first days
of her motherhood. Very soon Sunna and Adriana
became one and he was fast asleep in his
chair.</p>
<p>In the morning Sunna kept her intention. She
poured out her grandfather&#8217;s coffee, and talked of
everything but the thing in her heart and purpose.
After breakfast she said: &#8220;I shall put the day past
with Thora Ragnor. Thy dinner will be served
for thee by Elga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking thou wilt be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of nothing that ought to be kept quiet. Do
not come for me if I am late; I intend that Boris
shall bring me home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna dressed herself in a pretty lilac lawn
frock, trimmed with the then new and fashionable
Scotch open work, and fresh lilac ribbons. Her
hair was arranged as Boris liked it best, and it
was shielded by one of those fine, large Tuscan
hats that have never, even yet, gone out of fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sunna!&#8221; cried Thora, as she hastened to
meet her friend, &#8220;how glad am I to see thee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wert in my heart this morning, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
said to it &#8216;Be content, in an hour I will take thee to
thy desire.&#8217;&#8221; And they clasped hands, and walked
thus into the house. &#8220;Art thou not tired after
the dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Thora, &#8220;I was very happy. Do
happy people get tired?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;one can only bear so much happiness,
then it is weariness&ndash;&ndash;sometimes crossness. Too
much of any good thing is a bad thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How wise thou art, Sunna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I live with wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Adam Vedder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and thou hast been living with Love, with
Mr. Macrae. Very handsome and good-natured
he is. I am sure that thou art in love with him!
Is that not the case?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very much in love with me he is, Sunna. It
is a great happiness. I do not weary of it, no,
indeed! To believe in love, to feel it all around
you! It is wonderful! You know, Sunna&ndash;&ndash;surely
you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I, too, have been in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Boris&ndash;&ndash;I know. And also Boris is in
love with thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is wrong. No longer does Boris love
me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But that is impossible. Love for one hour is
love forever. He did love thee, then he could not
forget. Never could he forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not notice me last night. Thou must
have seen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not notice&ndash;&ndash;but I heard some talk about
it. The first time thou art alone with him, he will
tell thee his trouble. It is only a little cloud&ndash;&ndash;it
will pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the enlisting ship sails northaway
first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to Lerwick, though they may stop at Fair
Island on the way. Boris says they could get many
men there&ndash;&ndash;and Boris knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou going to the pier to see them leave?
I suppose every one goes. Shall we go together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sunna! They left this morning about
four o&#8217;clock. Father went down to the pier with
Boris. Boris sailed with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora! Thora! I thought Boris was to remain
here until the naval party returned from
Shetland?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lieutenant in command thought Boris
could help the enlisting, for in Lerwick Boris has
many friends. Thou knows my sisters Anna and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Nenie live in Lerwick. Boris was fain to go and
see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will return here when their business
is finished in Lerwick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They spoke of doing so, but mother is not believing
they will return. They took with them all
the men enlisted here and the men are wanted very
much. Boris did not bid us a short &#8216;good-bye.&#8217;
Mother was crying, and when he kissed me his
tears wet my cheeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna did not answer. For a few minutes she
felt as if her heart had suddenly died. At last she
blundered out:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the officer was afraid that&ndash;&ndash;Boris
might slip off while he was away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, thou supposes what is wrong.
When a fight is the question, Boris needs no one
either to watch him or to egg him on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that youngster, Macrae, going to join? Or
has he already taken the Queen&#8217;s shilling? I think
I heard such a report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one could have told that story. Macrae is
bound by a contract to McLeod for this year and
indeed, just yet, he does not wish to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not wish to leave thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not out of likelihood.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Many are saying that England is in great
stress, and my grandfather thinks that so she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father says &#8216;not so.&#8217; If indeed it were so,
my father would have gone with Boris. Mother
is cross about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About what then is she cross?&#8221; asked Sunna.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are saying that England is in stress.
Mother says such words are nothing but men&#8217;s
&#8216;fear talk.&#8217; England&#8217;s sons are many, and if few
they were, she has millions of daughters who
would gladly fight for her!&#8221; said Thora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, for heroics there is no present
need! I surely thought Boris loved his business
and would not leave his money-making.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could thou tell me what incalculable sum of
money a man would take for his honour and patriotism?&#8221;
asked Thora.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has honour to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything; a man without honour is not a
man&ndash;&ndash;he is just &#8216;a body&#8217;; he has no soul. Robert
Burns told Andrew Horner how such men were
made!&#8221; replied Thora.</p>
<p>&#8220;How was that? Tell me! A Burns&#8217; anecdote
will put grandfather in his finest temper, and I
want him in that condition for I have a great
favour to ask from him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The tale tells that when Burns was beginning
to write, he had a rival in a man called Andrew
Horner. One day they met at the same club dinner,
and they were challenged to each write a verse
within five minutes. The gentlemen guests took
out their watches, the poets were furnished with
pencils and paper. When time was up Andrew
Horner had not written the first line but Burns
handed to the chairman his verse complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me. If you know it, tell me, Thora!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it. If you hear it once you do
not forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It runs thus:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;&#8216;Once on a time<br />
The Deil gat stuff to mak&#8217; a swine<br />
And put it in a corner;<br />
But afterward he changed his plan<br />
And made it summat like a man,<br />
And ca&#8217;ed it Andrew Horner.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;That is good! It will delight grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt he already knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I should have heard it a thousand times,
if he knew it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I believe it has been suppressed.
Many think it too ill-natured for Burns to have
written; but my father says it has the true Burns
ring and is Robert Burns&#8217; writing without doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will give grandfather a nice long job of investigation.
That is one of his favourite amusements,
and all Sunna has to do is to be sure he is
right and everybody else wrong. Now I will go
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay with me today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Macrae will be here soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncertain is that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every hair on thy head, Thora, every article
of thy dress, from the lace at thy throat to the sandals
on thy feet, say to me that this is a time when
my absence will be better than my company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, do as thou art minded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is best I do so. A happy morning to thee!
What more is in my heart shall lie quiet at this
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna went away with the air of a happy, careless
girl, but she said many angry words to herself
as she hasted on the homeward road. &#8220;Most
of the tales tell how women are made to suffer
by the men they love&ndash;&ndash;but no tale shall be made
about Sunna Vedder! <i>No!</i> <i>No!</i> It is Boris
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Ragnor I shall turn into laughter&ndash;&ndash;he has mocked
my very heart&ndash;&ndash;I will never forgive him&ndash;&ndash;that is
the foolish way all women take&ndash;&ndash;all but Sunna
Vedder&ndash;&ndash;she will neither forgive nor forget&ndash;&ndash;she
will follow up this affair&ndash;&ndash;yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>By such promises to herself she gradually regained
her usual reasonable poise, and with a
smiling face sought her grandfather. She found
him in his own little room sitting at a table covered
with papers. He looked up as she entered
and, in spite of his intention, answered her smile
and greeting with an equal plentitude of good will
and good temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought then, that thou would stay with
thy friend all day, and for that reason I took out
work not to be chattered over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go away now. I came to thee because
things have not gone as I wanted them. Thy
counsel at such ill times is the best that can happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Vedder threw down his pencil and turned
to her. &#8220;Who has given thee wrong or despite
or put thee out of the way thou wanted to take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Boris Ragnor. He has sailed north with
the recruiting company&ndash;&ndash;without a word to me he
has gone. He has thrown my love back in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
face. Should thy grandchild forgive him? I am
both Vedder and Fae. How can I forgive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vedder took out his watch and looked at the
time. &#8220;We have an hour before dinner. Sit
down and I will talk to thee. First thou shalt tell
me the very truth anent thy quarrel with Boris.
What did thou do, or say, that has so far grieved
him? Now, then, all of it. Then I can judge if
it be Boris or Sunna, that is wrong in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen then. Boris heard some men talking
about me&ndash;&ndash;that made his temper rise&ndash;&ndash;then he
heard from these men that I was dancing at
McLeod&#8217;s and he went there to see, and as it happened
I was dancing with McLeod when he entered
the room, and he walked up to me in the
dance and said thou wanted me, and he made me
come home with him and scolded me all the time
we were together. I asked him not to tell thee,
and he promised he would not&ndash;&ndash;if I went there no
more. I have not danced with McLeod since, except
at Mrs. Brodie&#8217;s. Thou saw me then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou should not have entered McLeod&#8217;s
house&ndash;&ndash;what excuse hast thou for that fault?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many have talked of the fault, none but thou
have asked me why or how it came that I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
so foolish. I will tell thee the very truth. I went
to spend the day with Nana Bork&ndash;&ndash;with thy consent
I went&ndash;&ndash;and towards afternoon there came
an invitation from McLeod to Nana to join an informal
dance that night at eight o&#8217;clock. And
Nana told me so many pleasant things about these
little dances I could not resist her talk and I
thought if I stayed with Nana all night thou
would never know. I have heard that I stole
away out of thy house to go to McLeod&#8217;s. I did
not! I went with Nana Bork whose guest I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did thou not tell me this before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew no one in Kirkwall would dare to say
to thee this or that about thy grandchild, and I
hoped thou would never know. I am sorry for
my disobedience; it has always hurt me&ndash;&ndash;if thou
forgive it now, so much happier I will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Adam drew her to his side and kissed her,
and words would have been of all things the most
unnecessary. But he moved a chair close to him,
and she sat down in it and laid her hand upon his
knee and he clasped and covered it with his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very unkindly Boris has treated thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has mocked at my love before all Kirkwall.
Well, then, it is Thora Ragnor&#8217;s complacency that
affronts me most. If she would put her boasting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
into words, I could answer her; but who can answer
looks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in the heaven of her first love. Thou
should understand that condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beyond my understanding; nor would I
try to understand such a lover as Ian Macrae. I
believe that he is a hypocrite&ndash;&ndash;Thora is so easily
deceived&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thou?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not deceived. I see Boris just as he is,
rude and jealous and hateful, but I think him a
far finer man than Ian Macrae ever has been, or
ever will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Thou art right. Now then, let this affair
lie still in thy heart. I think that he will
come to see thee when the boats return from Shetland&ndash;&ndash;if
not, then I shall have something to say in
the matter. I shall want my dinner very soon, and
some other thing we will talk about. Let it go until
there is a word to say or a movement to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be ready for thee at twelve o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
With a feeling of content in her heart, Sunna went
away. Had she not the Burns story to tell? Yet
she felt quite capable of restraining the incident
until she got to a point where its relation would
serve her purpose or her desire.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> following two weeks were a time of
anxiety concerning Boris. The recruiting
party with whom he had gone away had said positively
they must return with whatever luck they
had in two weeks; and this interval appeared to
Sunna to be of interminable length. She spent a
good deal of the time with Thora affecting to console
her for the loss of Ian Macrae, who had left
Kirkwall for Edinburgh a few days after the departure
of Boris.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We are &#8216;a couple of maidens all forlorn,&#8217;&#8221; she
sang, and though Thora disclaimed the situation,
she could not prevent her companion insisting on
the fact.</p>
<p>Thora, however, did not feel that she had any
reason for being forlorn. Ian&#8217;s love for her had
been confessed, not only to herself, but also to
her father and mother, and the marriage agreed
to with a few reservations, whose wisdom the lovers
fully acknowledged. She was receiving the
most ardent love letters by every mail and she had
not one doubt of her lover in any respect. Indeed,
her happiness so pervaded her whole person
and conduct that Sunna felt it sometimes to be
both depressing and irritating.</p>
<p>Thora, however, was the sister of Boris, she
could not quarrel with her. She had great influence
over Boris, and Sunna loved Boris&ndash;&ndash;loved
him in spite of her anger and of his neglect.
Very slowly went the two weeks the enlisting ships
had fixed as the length of their absence, but the
news of their great success made their earlier return
most likely, and after the tenth day every one
was watching for them and planning a great patriotic
reception.</p>
<p>Still the two weeks went slowly away and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
was a full day past this fixed time, and the ships
were not in port nor even in sight, nor had any
late news come from them. In the one letter
which Rahal had received from her son he said:
&#8220;The enlistment has been very satisfactory; our
return may be even a day earlier than we expected.&#8221;
So Sunna had begun to watch for the
party three days before the set time, and when it
was two days after it she was very unhappy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do they not come, Thora?&#8221; she asked
in a voice trembling with fear. &#8220;Do you think
they have been wrecked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Nothing of the kind! They may
have sailed westward to Harris. My father thinks
so.&#8221; But she appeared so little interested that
Sunna turned to Mistress Ragnor and asked her
opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; answered Rahal, &#8220;they <i>are</i> staying
longer than was expected, but who can tell
what men in a ship will do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will surely keep their word and promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&ndash;&ndash;if it seem a good thing to them.
Can thou not see? They are masters on board
ship. Once out of Lerwick Bay, the whole world
is before them. Know this, they might go East
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
or West, and say to no man &#8216;I ask thy leave.&#8217;
As changeable as the sea is a sailor&#8217;s promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Boris is thy son&ndash;&ndash;he promised thee to be
home in two weeks. Men do not break a promise
made on their mother&#8217;s lips. How soon dost
thou expect him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the harbour mouth he might be, even this
very minute. I want to see my boy. I love him.
May the good God send those together who
would fain be loved!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris is in command of his own ship. He
was under no man&#8217;s orders. He ought not to
break his promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With my will, he would never do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou think he will go to the war with the
other men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That he might do. What woman is there who
can read a man&#8217;s heart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She might, a little way&ndash;&ndash;no further&ndash;&ndash;just as
well &#8216;no further.&#8217; Only God is wise enough, and
patient enough, to read a human heart. This is a
great mercy.&#8221; And Rahal lifted her face from
her sewing a moment and then dropped it again.</p>
<p>Almost in a whisper Sunna said &#8220;Good-bye!&#8221;
and then went her way home. She walked rapidly;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
she was in a passion of grief and mortification,
but she sang some lilting song along the
highway. As soon, however, as she passed inside
the Vedder garden gates, the singing was changed
into a scornful, angry monologue:</p>
<p>&#8220;These Ragnor women! Oh, their intolerable
good sense! So easy it is to talk sweetly and
properly when you have no great trouble and all
your little troubles are well arranged! Women
cannot comfort women. No, they can not! They
don&#8217;t want to, if they could. Like women, I do
not! Trust them, I do not! I wish that God had
made me a man! I will go to my dear old grandad!&ndash;&ndash;He
will do something&ndash;&ndash;so sorry I am that
I let Thora see I loved her brother&ndash;&ndash;when I go
there again, I shall consider his name as the
bringer-on of yawns and boredom!&#8221;</p>
<p>An angry woman carries her heart in her
mouth; but Sunna had been trained by a wise old
man, and no one knew better than Sunna Vedder
did, when to speak and when to be silent. She
went first to her room in order to repair those
disturbances to her appearance which had been induced
by her inward heat and by her hurried
walk home so near the noontide; and half an hour
later she came down to dinner fresh and cool as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
a rose washed in the dew of the morning. Her
frock of muslin was white as snow, there was a
bow of blue ribbon at her throat, her whole appearance
was delightfully satisfying. She opened
her grandfather&#8217;s parlour and found him sitting at
a table covered with papers and little piles of gold
and silver coin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I was a thief, Grandfather?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, what would thou take first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would take a kiss!&#8221; and she laid her face
against his face, and gave him one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, thou could take all there is. What dost
thou want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want thee! Dinner is ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come. In ten minutes, I will come&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
and in less than ten minutes he was at the dinner
table, and apparently a quite different man from
the one Sunna had invited there. He had changed
his coat, his face was happy and careless, and he
had quite forgotten the papers and the little piles
of silver and gold.</p>
<p>Sunna had said some things to Thora she was
sorry for saying; she did not intend to repeat this
fault with her grandfather. Even the subject of
Boris could lie still until a convenient hour. She
appeared, indeed, to have thrown off her anger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and her disappointment with the unlucky clothing
she had worn in her visit to Thora. She had even
assured herself of this change, for when it fell to
her feet she lifted it reluctantly between her finger
and thumb and threw it aside, remarking as she
did so, &#8220;I will have them all washed over again!
Soda and soap may make them more agreeable
and more fortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>And perhaps if we take the trouble to notice the
fact, clothing does seem to have some sort of
sympathy or antagonism with its wearers. Also, it
appears to take on the mood or feeling predominant,
looking at one time crisp and perfectly
proper, at another time limp and careless, as if
the wearer informed the garment or the garment
explained the wearer. It is well known that
&#8220;Fashions are the external expression of the mental
states of a country, and that if its men and
women degenerate in their character, their fashions
become absurd.&#8221; Surely then, a sympathy
which can affect a nation has some influence upon
the individual. Sunna had noticed even in her
childhood that her dresses were lucky and unlucky,
but the why or the wherefore of the circumstance
had never troubled her. She had also noticed
that her grandfather liked and disliked certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
colours and modes, but she laid all their differences
to difference in age.</p>
<p>This day, however, they were in perfect accord.
He looked at her and nodded his head, and
then smilingly asked: &#8220;How did thou find thy
friend this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much in love that she had not one regret
for Boris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, there is no reason for regret.
Boris has taken the path of honour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be so, but for the time to come I
shall put little trust in him. Going such a dubious
way, he might well have stopped for a God Bless
Thee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would thou have said that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we ask about things impossible?
Dost thou know, Grandfather, at what time the
recruiting party passed Kirkwall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knows. I heard music out at sea
three nights ago, just after midnight. There are
no Shetland boats carrying music. It is more
likely than not to have been the recruiting party
saluting us with music as they went by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! I think thou art right. Grandfather,
I want thee to tell me what we are fighting
about.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Many times thou hast said &#8216;it made no matter
to thee.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, it is different. Since Boris and so
many of our men went away, Mistress Ragnor
and Thora talk of the war and of nothing but
the war. They know all about it. They wanted
to tell me all about it. I said thou had told me
all that was proper for me to know, and now
then, thou must make my words true. What is
England quarrelling about? It seems to me, that
somebody is always looking at her in a way she
does not think respectful enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This war is not England&#8217;s fault. She has done
all she could to avoid it. It is the Great Bear of
Russia who wants Turkey put out of Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I heard the Bishop say the Turks
were a disgrace to Europe, and that the Book of
Common Prayer had once contained a petition for
delivery from the Devil, the Turks, and the comet,
then flaming in the sky and believed to be threatening
destruction to the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, and I will tell thee the truth. The
Greek population of Turkey, its Syrians and Armenians,
are the oldest Christians in the world.
They are also the most numerous and important
class of the Sultan&#8217;s subjects. Russia also has a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
large number of Russian Christians in Turkey
over whom she wants a protectorate, but these
two influences would be thorns in the side of
Turkey. England has bought favour for the
Christians she protects, by immense loans of
money and other political advantages, but neither
the Turk nor the English want Russia&#8217;s power
inside of Turkey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turkey is in a bad way. A few weeks ago
the Czar said to England, &#8216;We have on our hands
a sick man, a very sick man. I tell you frankly,
it will be a great misfortune if one of these days he
should slip away from us, especially if it were before
all necessary arrangements were made. The
Czar wants Turkey out of his way. He wants
Constantinople for his own southern capital, he
wants the Black Sea for a Russian lake, and the
Danube for a Russian river. He wants many
other unreasonable things, which England cannot
listen to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, I think the Russian would be better
than the Turk in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing is sure; in the hour that England
joins Russia, Turkey will slay every Christian in
her territories. Dost thou think England will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
inaugurate a huge massacre of Christians?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not thinkable. Is there nothing
more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, there is India. The safety of our
Indian Empire would be endangered over the
whole line between East and West if Russia was
in Constantinople. Turkey lies across Egypt,
Syria, Asia Minor and Armenia, and above all
at Constantinople and the Straits. Dost thou
think England would ask Russia&#8217;s permission every
time she wished to go to India?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed! That, itself, is a good reason for
fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the Englishman always wants a moral
backbone for his quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is as it should be. The Armenian Christians
supply that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Sunna, try and imagine to thyself a great
military despotic Power seating itself at Constantinople,
throwing its right hand over Asia Minor,
Syria and Egypt; and its left holding in an iron
grip the whole north of two continents; keeping
the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus closed whenever
it was pleased to do so, and building fleets in
Egypt; and in Armenia, commanding the desirable
road to India by the Euphrates.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that could not be suffered! Impossible!
All the women in Kirkwall would fight against
such a condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so matters stand, and we had been at
sword points a year ago but for Lord Aberdeen&#8217;s
cowardly, pernicious love of peace. But he is always
whining about &#8216;war destroying wealth and
commerce&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;as if wealth and commerce were of
greater worth than national honour and justice
and mercy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, one thing is sure, Grandad; war is wasteful
and destructive&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And one thing is truer still&ndash;&ndash;it is this&ndash;&ndash;<i>that
national wealth is created by peace for the very
purpose of defending the nation in war</i>. Bear
this in mind. Now, it seems to me we have had
enough of war. I see Elga coming with a dish
of good Scotch collops, and I give thee my word
that I will not spoil their savour by any unpleasant
talk.&#8221; Then he poured a little fine Glenlivet
into a good deal of water and said: &#8220;Here&#8217;s first
to the glory of God! and then to the honour of
England!&#8221; And Sunna touched his glass with
her glass and the little ceremony put both in a very
happy mood.</p>
<p>Then Sunna saw that the moment she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
waited for had arrived and she said: &#8220;I will tell
thee a good story of Robert Burns to flavour thy
collops. Will that be to thy wish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beyond my wish. Thou can not tell me
one I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard one today from Thora Ragnor that
I never heard thee tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it cannot be fit for thee and Thora Ragnor
to repeat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou hear it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it about some girl he loved?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is about a man he scorned. Thou must
have heard of Andrew Horner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard the creature&#8217;s name before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the story will be fresh to thee. Will
thou hear it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As well now, as later.&#8221; For Adam really had
no expectation of hearing anything he had not already
heard and judged; and he certainly expected
nothing unusual from the proper and commonplace
Thora Ragnor. But Sunna exerted all her
facial skill and eloquence, and told the clever incident
with wonderful spirit and delightful mimicry.
Adam was enchanted; he threw down his
knife and fork and made the room ring with
laughter and triumph so genuine that Sunna&ndash;&ndash;much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
against her will&ndash;&ndash;was compelled to laugh
with him. They heard the happy thunder in the
kitchen, and wondered whatever was the matter
with the Master.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Robert Burns, his own self, and no other
man. It is the best thing I have heard from &#8216;the
lad that was born in Kyle!&#8217;&#8221; Vedder cried. &#8220;Ill-natured!
Not a bit of it! Just what the Horner
man deserved!&#8221; Then he took some more collops
and a fresh taste of Glenlivet, and anon broke
into laughter again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! but I wish I was in Edinburgh tonight!
There&#8217;s men there I would go to see and have my
laugh out with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather, why should we not go to Edinburgh
next winter? You could board me with
Mistress Brodie, and come every day to sort our
quarrels and see that I was properly treated.
Then you could have your crow over the ignoramuses
who did not know such a patent Burns
story; and I could take lessons in music and singing,
and be learning something or seeing something,
every hour of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about Boris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very name of Boris tires my tongue! I
can do without Boris.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, that is good! Thou art learning
&#8216;the grand habit of doing without.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou take me to Edinburgh? My mother
would like thee to do that. I think I deserve it,
Grandfather; yes, and so I ask thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was going, I should have no mind to go
without thee. One thing I wish to know&ndash;&ndash;in what
way hast thou deserved it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not expect thee to ask me a question like
that. Have I fretted and pined, and forgot to
eat and sleep, and gone dowdy and slovenly, because
my lover has been fool enough to desert me?
Well, then, that is what any other girl would have
done. But because I am of thy blood and stock,
I take what comes to me as part of my day&#8217;s work,
and make no more grumble on the matter than one
does about bad weather. Is that not the truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing is sure&ndash;&ndash;thou art the finest all round
girl in the Orcades.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it seems to me thou should take me to
Edinburgh. I want that something, that polish,
only great cities can give me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessings on thee! All Edinburgh can give,
thou shalt have! But it is my advice to thee to
remain here until Mrs. Brodie goes back, then go
thou with her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That will be what it should be. Mrs. Brodie,
I feel, will be my stepmother; and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will never step past thee. Fear not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor will any one&ndash;&ndash;man or woman&ndash;&ndash;step between
thee and me! Doubt me not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, have thy way. I give thee my
word to take thee to Edinburgh in the autumn.
Thou shalt either stay with Mrs. Brodie or at the
Queen&#8217;s Hotel on Prince&#8217;s Street, with old Adam
Vedder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Best of all is thy last offer. I will stay with
thee. I am used to men&#8217;s society. Women bore
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women bore me also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know this, there are three women who do not
bore thee. Shall I speak their names?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not hinder thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunna Vedder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love her. She cannot bore me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rahal Ragnor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I respect her. She does not bore me&ndash;&ndash;often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is so; it is but seldom thou sees her.
Well, then, Barbara Brodie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I once loved her. She can never be indifferent
to me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast told me the truth and I will not
follow up this catechism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For that favour, I am thy debtor. I might not
always have been so truthful. Now, then, be honest
with me. What wilt thou do all the summer,
with no lover to wait on thy whims and fancies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On thee I shall rely. Where thou goes, I will
go, and if thou stay at home, with thee I will stay.
Thou can read to me. I have never heard any of
our great Sagas and that is a shame. I complain
of that neglect in my education! I heard Maximus
Grant recite from &#8216;The Banded Men and
Haakon the Good,&#8217; when I was in Edinburgh, and
I said to myself, &#8216;how much finer is this, than opera
songs, sung with a Scotch burr, in the Italian; or
than English songs, sung by Scotch people who
pronounce English after the Scotch fashion!&#8217;
Then I made up my mind that this coming winter
I would let Edinburgh drawing-rooms hear the
songs of Norse warriors; the songs in which the
armour rattles and the swords shine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, indeed, will befit thee! Now, then, for
the summer, keep thyself well in hand. Say nothing
of thy plans, for if but once the wind catches
them, they will soon be for every one to talk to
death.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>Adam was finishing his plate of rice pudding
and cream when he gave this advice; and with it,
he moved his chair from the table and said:
&#8220;Come into the garden. I want to smoke. Thou
knows a good dinner deserves a pipe, and a bad
one demands it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they went into the garden and talked of
the flowers and the young vegetables, and said not
a word of Edinburgh and the Sagas that the winds
could catch and carry round to human folk for
clash and gossip. And when the pipe was out,
Adam said: &#8220;Now I am going into the town.
That Burns story is on my lips, my teeth
cannot keep my tongue behind them much
longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good time will be thine. I wish that I
could go with thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What wilt thou do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Braid my hair and dress myself. Then I shall
take out thy Saga of &#8216;The Banded Men&#8217; and study
the men who were banded, and find them out, in
all their clever ways. Then I can show them to
others. If I get tired of them&ndash;&ndash;and I do get tired
of men very quickly&ndash;&ndash;I will put on my bonnet and
tippet, and go and carry Mrs. Brodie thy respectful&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Take care, Sunna!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good wishes! I can surely go so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know this&ndash;&ndash;every step on that road may lead
to danger&ndash;&ndash;and thou cannot turn back and tread
them the other way. There now, be off! I will
talk with thee no longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna said something about Burns in reply, but
Vedder heard her not. He was satisfying his
vocal impatience by whistling softly and very
musically &#8220;The Garb of Old Gaul,&#8221; and Sunna
watched and listened a moment, and then in something
of a hurry went to her room. A new
thought had come to her&ndash;&ndash;one which pleased her
very much; and she proceeded to dress herself accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;None too good is my Easter gown,&#8221; she said
pleasantly to herself; &#8220;and I can take Eric a basket
of the oranges grandfather brought home today.
A treat to the dear little lad they will be.
Before me is a long afternoon, and I shall find
the proper moment to ask the advice of Maximus
about &#8216;The Banded Men.&#8217;&#8221; So with inward
smiles she dressed herself, and then took
the highway in a direction not very often taken
by her.</p>
<p>It led her to a handsome mansion overlooking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
the Venice of the Orcades, the village and the wonderful
Bay of Kirkwall, into which</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='ralign cg'>... by night and day,</p>
<p class='cg'>The great sea water finds its way<br />
Through long, long windings of the hills.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The house had a silent look, and its enclosure was
strangely quiet, though kept in exquisite order and
beauty. As she approached, a lady about fifty
years old came to the top of the long, white steps
to meet her, appearing to be greatly pleased with
her visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only at dinner time Max was speaking of thee!
And Eric said his sweetheart had forgotten him,
and wondering we all were, what had kept thee so
long away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, thou knowest about the war and
the enlisting&ndash;&ndash;everyone, in some way, has been
touched by the changes made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True is that! Quickly thou must come in, for
Eric has both second-sight and hearing, and no
doubt he knows already that here thou art&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
and talking thus as she went, Mrs. Beaton led the
way up a wide, light stairway. Even as Mrs. Beaton
was speaking a thin, eager voice called Sunna&#8217;s
name, a door flew open, and a man, beautiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
as a dream-man, stood in the entrance to welcome
them. And here the word &#8220;beautiful&#8221; need not
to be erased; it was the very word that sprang
naturally from the heart to the lips of every one
when they met Maximus Grant. No Greek sculptor
ever dreamed of a more perfect form and
face; the latter illumined by noticeable grey eyes,
contemplative and mystical, a face, thoughtful and
winning, and constantly breaking into kind smiles.</p>
<p>He took Sunna&#8217;s hand, and they went quickly
forward to a boy of about eleven years old, whom
Sunna kissed and petted. The little lad was in a
passion of delight. He called her &#8220;his sweetheart!
his wife! his Queen!&#8221; and made her take
off her bonnet and cloak and sit down beside him.
He was half lying in a softly cushioned chair;
there was a large globe at his side, and an equally
large atlas, with other books on a small table near
by, and Max&#8217;s chair was close to the whole arrangement.
He was a fair, lovely boy, with the
seraphic eyes that sufferers from spinal diseases
so frequently possess&ndash;&ndash;eyes with the look in them
of a Conqueror of Pain. But also, on his young
face there was the solemn Trophonean pallor
which signs those who daily dare &#8220;to look at death
in the cave.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Max and I have been to the Greek islands,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and Sunna, as soon as I am grown up,
and am quite well, I shall ask thee to marry me,
and then we will go to one of the loveliest of them
and live there. Max thinks that would be just
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou little darling,&#8221; answered Sunna, &#8220;when
thou art a man, if thou ask me to marry thee, I
shall say &#8216;yes!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course thou wilt. Sunna loves Eric?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, indeed, Eric! I think we should be very
happy. We should never quarrel or be cross with
each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I would not like that! If we did not
quarrel, there would be no making-up. I remember
papa and mamma making-up their little tiffs,
and they seemed to be very happy about it&ndash;&ndash;and
to love each other ever so much better for the tiff
and the make-up. I think we must have little quarrels,
Sunna; and then, long, long, happy makings-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Eric; only, thou must make the
quarrel. With thee I could not quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should begin it in this way: &#8216;Sunna, I do not
approve of thy dancing with&ndash;&ndash;say&ndash;&ndash;Ken McLeod.&#8217;
Then thou wilt say: &#8216;I shall dance with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
whom I like, Eric&#8217;; and I will reply: &#8216;thou art my
wife and I will not allow thee to dance with McLeod&#8217;;
and then thou wilt be naughty and saucy
and proud, and I shall have to be angry and masterful;
and as thou art going out of the room in a
terrible temper, I shall say, &#8216;Sunna!&#8217; in a sweet
voice, and look at thee, and thou wilt look at me,
with those heavenly eyes, and then I shall open
my arms and thou wilt fly to my embrace, and the
making-up will begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, that will be delightful, Eric, but
thou must not accuse me of anything so bad as
dancing with Mr. McLeod.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that be bad to thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very bad, indeed! I fear I would never try
to have a &#8216;make-up&#8217; with any one who thought I
would dance with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou dislike him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is neither here nor there. He is a Scot.
I may marry like the rest of the world, but while
my life days last, Sunna Vedder will not marry a
Scot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;but there was some talk that way.
My aunt heard it. My aunt hears everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell thee, talk that way was all lies. No
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
one will Sunna Vedder marry, that is not of her
race.&#8221; Then she put her arms round Eric, and
kissed his wan face, calling him &#8220;her own little
Norseman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Sunna, what is happening in the
town?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, not much now. Men are talking
of the war, and going to the war, and empty is the
town. About the war, art thou sorry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am glad&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;How glorious the valiant, sword in hand,<br />
In front of battle for their native land!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And he raised his small, thin hands, and his
face glowed, and he looked like a young St.
Michael.</p>
<p>Then Max lifted the globe and books aside and
put his chair close to his brother&#8217;s. &#8220;Eric has the
soul of a soldier,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the sound of
drums and trumpets stirs him like the cry of fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so it happens, Mr. Grant, that we have
much noise lately from the trumpets and the fife
and drums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, man is a military animal, he loves
parade,&#8221; answered Max.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But in this war, there is much more than
parade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Miss Vedder. It was
prompted by that gigantic heart-throb with which,
even across oceans, we feel each other&#8217;s rights and
wrongs. And in this way we learn best that we
are men and brothers. Can a man do more for
a wrong than give his life to right it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Eric cried out with hysterical passion: &#8220;I
wish only that I might have my way with Aberdeen!
Oh, the skulking cowards who follow him!
Max! Max! If you would mount our father&#8217;s
big war horse and hold me in front of you and
ride into the thick of the battle, and let me look on
the cold light of the lifted swords! Oh, the shining
swords! They shake! They cry out! The
lives of men are in them! Max! Max! I want
to die&ndash;&ndash;on a&ndash;&ndash;battlefield!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Max held the weeping boy in his arms,
and bowed his head over him and whispered
words too tender and sacred to be written
down.</p>
<p>For a while Eric was exhausted; he lay still
watching his brother and Sunna, and listening to
their conversation. They were talking of the excitement
in London, and of the pressure of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
clergy putting down the reluctancies and falterings
of the peace men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard, Miss Vedder,&#8221; said Grant,
&#8220;that one of the bishops decided England&#8217;s call
to war by a wonderful sermon in St. Paul&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to be ignorant. Tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He preached from Jeremiah, Fourth Chapter
and Sixth Verse; and his closing cry was from
Nahum, Second Chapter and First Verse, &#8216;Set up
the standard toward Zion. Stay not, for I will
bring evil from the north and a great destruction,&#8217;
and he closed with Nahum&#8217;s advice, &#8216;He that
dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face, keep
the munition, watch the way, make thy loins
strong, fortify thy power mightily.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, how went the advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not exactly. It is hard to convince
commerce and cowardice that at certain times war
is the highest of all duties. Neither of them understand
patriotism; and yet every trembling pacifist
in time of war is a misfortune to his country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the country will give them&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221;
asked Sunna.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cold, dead damnation of a disgrace they
will never outlive,&#8221; answered Max.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>There was a sharp cry from Eric at these
words, and then a passionate childish exclamation&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Not
bad enough! Not bad enough!&#8221; he
screamed. &#8220;Oh, if I had a sword and a strong
hand! I would cut them up in slices!&#8221; Then with
an hysterical cry the boy fell backward.</p>
<p>In an instant Max had him in his arms and was
whispering words of promise and consolation, and
just then, fortunately, Mrs. Beaton entered with
a servant who was carrying a service of tea and
muffins. It was a welcome diversion and both
Max and Sunna were glad of it. Max gently unloosed
Eric&#8217;s hand from Sunna&#8217;s clasp and then
they both looked at the child. He had fallen into
a sleep of exhaustion and Max said, &#8220;It is well.
When he is worn out with feeling, such sleeps
alone save his life. I am weary, also. Let us
have a cup of tea.&#8221; So they sat down and talked
of everything but the war&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;He would hear us
in his sleep,&#8221; said Max, &#8220;and he has borne all he
is able to bear today.&#8221; Then Sunna said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Right glad am I to put a stop to such a trouble-raising
subject. War is a thing by itself, and all
that touches it makes people bereft of their senses
or some other good thing. Here has come news
of Thora Ragnor&#8217;s hurried marriage, but no one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
knows or cares about the strange things happening
at our doorstep. Such haste is not good I
fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Ragnor approve of it?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Beaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora&#8217;s marriage is all right. They fell in
love with each other the moment they met. No
other marriage is possible for either. It is this,
or none at all,&#8221; answered Sunna.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the man was the son of a great Edinburgh
preacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the Rev. Dr. Macrae, of St. Mark&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I heard. He is a good man, but
a very hard one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he is hard, he is not good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou must not say that, little Miss; it may be
the Episcopalian belief, but we Calvinists have a
stronger faith&ndash;&ndash;a faith fit for men and soldiers
of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There! Mrs. Beaton, you are naming soldiers.
That is against our agreement to drop war
talk. About Macrae I know nothing. He is not
aware that anyone but Thora Ragnor lives; and
I was not in the least attracted by him&ndash;&ndash;his black
hair and black eyes repelled me&ndash;&ndash;I dislike such
men.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Will they live in Edinburgh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe they will live in Kirkwall. Mrs.
Ragnor owns a pretty house, which she will give
them. She is going to put it in order and furnish
it from the roof to the foundation. Thora is busy
about her napery&ndash;&ndash;the finest of Irish linen and damask.
Now then, I must hurry home. My grandfather
will be waiting his tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max rose with her. He looked at his little
brother and said: &#8220;Aunt, he will sleep now
for a few hours, will you watch him till I
return?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I not? You know he is as safe with me
as yourself, Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>So with an acknowledging smile of content, he
took Sunna&#8217;s hand and led her slowly down the
stairway. There was a box running all across the
sill of the long window, lighting the stairs, and it
was full and running over with the delicious muck
plant. Sunna laid her face upon its leaves for a
moment, and the whole place was thrilled with its
heavenly perfume. Then she smiled at Max and
his heart trembled with joy; yet he said a little
abruptly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Let us make haste. The night grows
cloudy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their way took them through the village, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
Sunna knew that she would, in all likelihood, be
the first woman ever seen in Maximus Grant&#8217;s company.
The circumstance was pleasant to her, and
she carried herself with an air and manner that
she readily caught and copied from him. She
knew that there was a face at every window, but
she did not turn her head one way or the other.
Max was talking to her about the Sagas and she
had a personal interest in the Sagas, and any ambition
she had to be socially popular was as yet
quite undeveloped.</p>
<p>At the point where the Vedder and Ragnor
roads crossed each other, two men were standing,
talking. They were Ragnor and Vedder, and
Ragnor was at once aware of the identity of the
couple approaching; but Vedder appeared so unaware,
that Ragnor remarked: &#8220;I see Sunna, Vedder,
coming up the road, and with her is Colonel
Max Grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why &#8216;Colonel,&#8217; Ragnor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When General Grant died his son was a colonel
in the Life Guards. He left the army to care
for his brother. I heard that the Queen praised
him for doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the couple were so close, that it was impossible
to affect ignorance of their presence any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
longer; and the old men turned and saluted the
young couple. &#8220;I thank thee, Colonel,&#8221; said Vedder,
as he &#8220;changed hats&#8221; with the Colonel, &#8220;but
now I can relieve thee of the charge thou hast
taken. I am going home and Sunna will go with
me; but if thou could call on an old man about
some business, there is a matter I would like to
arrange with thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could go home with you now, Vedder, if
that would be suitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, it would be too much for me tonight. It
is concerning that waste land on the Stromness
road, near the little bridge. I would like to build
a factory there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be to my pleasure and advantage.
I will call on you and talk over the matter, at any
time you desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well and good! Say tomorrow at two
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three o&#8217;clock would be better for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, let it be.&#8221; Then he took Sunna&#8217;s hand
and she understood that her walk with Grant was
over. She thanked Max for his courtesy, sent a
message to Eric, and then said her good night
with a look into his eyes which dirled in his heart
for hours afterwards. Some compliments passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
between the men and then she found herself walking
home with her grandfather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou ought not to have seen me, Grandfather,&#8221;
she said a little crossly, &#8220;I was having
such a lovely walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not want to see thee, and have I not arranged
for thee something a great deal better on
tomorrow&#8217;s afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One never knows&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen; he is to come at three o&#8217;clock, it will
be thy fault if he leaves at four. Thou can make
tea for him&ndash;&ndash;thou can walk in the greenhouse and
the garden with him, thou can sing for him&ndash;&ndash;no,
let him sing for thee&ndash;&ndash;thou can ask him to help
thee with &#8216;The Banded Men&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;and if he goes away
before eight o&#8217;clock I will say to thee&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;take the
first man that asks thee for thou hast no woman-witchery
with which to pick and choose!&#8217; Grant
is a fine man. If thou can win him, thou wins
something worth while. He has always held himself
apart. His father was much like him. All
of them soldiers and proud as men are made, these
confounded, democratic days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what of Boris?&#8221; asked Sunna.</p>
<p>&#8220;May Boris rest wherever he is! Thou could
not compare Boris with Maximus Grant.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is the truth. In many ways they are not
comparable. Boris is a rough, passionate man.
Grant is a gentleman. Always I thought there
was something common in me; that must be the
reason why I prefer Boris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To vex me, thou art saying such untruthful
words. I know thy contradictions! Go now and
inquire after my tea. I am in want of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>During tea, nothing further was said of Maximus
Grant; but Sunna was in a very merry mood,
and Adam watched her, and listened to her in
a philosophical way;&ndash;&ndash;that is, he tried to make
out amid all her persiflage and bantering talk what
was her ruling motive and intent&ndash;&ndash;a thing no one
could have been sure of, unless they had heard
her talking to herself&ndash;&ndash;that mysterious confidence
in which we all indulge, and in which we all tell
ourselves the truth. Sunna was undressing her
hair and folding away her clothing as she visited
this confessional, but her revelations were certainly
honest, even if fragmentary, and full of
doubt and uncertainty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grant, indeed!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I am not
ready for Grant&ndash;&ndash;I believe I am afraid of the
man&ndash;&ndash;he would make me over&ndash;&ndash;make me like
himself&ndash;&ndash;in a month he would do it&ndash;&ndash;I like Boris
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
best! I should quarrel with Boris, of course, and
we should say words neither polite nor kind to
each other; but then Boris would do as that blessed
child said, &#8216;Look at me&#8217;; and I should look at him,
and the making-up would begin. Heigh-ho! I
wish it could begin tonight!&#8221; She was silent then
for a few minutes, and in a sadder voice added&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;with
Max I should become an angel&ndash;&ndash;and I
should have a life without a ripple&ndash;&ndash;I would hate
it, just as I hate the sea when it lies like a mirror
under the sunshine&ndash;&ndash;then I always want to scream
out for a great north wind and the sea in a passion,
shattering everything in its way. If I got
into that mood with Max, we should have a most
unpleasant time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; and she laughed and tossed
her pillows about, and then having found a comfortable
niche in one of them, she tucked her handsome
head into it and in a few moments the sleep
of youth and perfect health lulled her into a secret
garden in the Land of Dreams.</p>
<p>The next day Sunna appeared to be quite oblivious
regarding Grant&#8217;s visit and Vedder was
too well acquainted with his granddaughter to
speak of it. He only noticed that she was dressed
with a peculiar simplicity and neatness. At three
o&#8217;clock Grant was promptly at the Vedder House,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
and at half-past four the land in question had been
visited and subsequently bought and sold. Then
the cup of tea came in, and the walk in the garden
followed, and at six there was an ample meal,
and during the singing that followed it, Vedder
fell fast asleep, as was his custom, and when he
awoke Grant was just going and the clock was
striking ten. Vedder looked at Sunna and there
was no need for him to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was &#8216;The Banded Men,&#8217;&#8221; said Sunna with a
straight look at her grandfather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I know a woman who is a match
for any number of &#8216;banded men.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in all likelihood that woman will be a
Vedder. Good night, Grandfather.&#8221;</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> summer passed rapidly away for it was
full of new interests. Thora&#8217;s wedding was
to take place about Christmas or New Year, and
there were no ready-made garments in those days;
so all of her girl friends were eager to help her
needle. Sunna spent half the day with her and all
their small frets and jealousies were forgotten.
Early in the morning the work was lifted, and all
day long it went happily on, to their light-hearted
hopes and dreams. Then in June and September
Ian came to Kirkwall to settle his account
with McLeod, and at the same time, he remained
a week as the Ragnors&#8217; guest. There was also
Sunna&#8217;s intended visit to Edinburgh to talk about,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
and there was never a day in which the war and
its preparations did not make itself prominent.</p>
<p>One of the pleasantest episodes of this period
occurred early and related to Sunna. One morning
she received a small box from London, and
she was so amazed at the circumstance, that she
kept examining the address and wondering &#8220;who
could have sent it,&#8221; instead of opening the box.
However, when this necessity had been observed,
it revealed to her a square leather case, almost
like those used for jewelry, and her heart leaped
high with expectation. It was something, however,
that pleased her much more than jewelry;
it was a likeness of Boris, a daguerreotype&ndash;&ndash;the
first that had ever reached Kirkwall. A narrow
scrap of paper was within the clasp, on which
Boris had written, &#8220;I am all thine! Forget me
not!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunna usually made a pretense of despising
anything sentimental but this example filled her
heart with joy and satisfaction. And after it, she
took far greater pleasure in all the circumstances
relating to Thora&#8217;s marriage; for she had gained a
personal interest in them. Even the details of the
ceremony were now discussed and arranged in accord
with Sunna&#8217;s taste and suggestions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The altar and nave must be decorated with
flags and evergreens and all the late flowers we
can secure,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will not be many flowers, I fear,&#8221; answered
Mistress Ragnor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Grants have a large greenhouse. I shall
ask them to save all they possibly can. Maximus
Grant delights in doing a kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then thou must ask him, Sunna. He is thy
friend&ndash;&ndash;perhaps thy lover. So the talk goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them talk! My lover is far away. God
save him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where all good and fit men are gone&ndash;&ndash;to the
trenches. For my lover is much of a man, strong
and brave-hearted. He adores his country, his
home, and his kindred. He counts honour far
above money; and liberty, more than life. My
lover will earn the right to marry the girl he
loves, and become the father of free men and
women!&#8221; And Rahal answered proudly and tenderly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art surely meaning my son Boris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, thou art near to the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Rahal put her arm round Sunna and
kissed her. &#8220;Thou hast made me happy,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
said, and Sunna made her still more happy, when
she took out of the little bag fastened to her belt
the daguerreotype and showed her the strong,
handsome face of her soldier-sailor boy.</p>
<p>During all this summer Sunna was busy and
regular. She was at the Ragnors&#8217; every day until
the noon hour. Then she ate dinner with her
grandfather, who was as eager to discuss the news
and gossip Sunna had heard, as any old woman in
Kirkwall. He said: &#8220;Pooh! Pooh!&#8221; and &#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;
but he listened to it, and it often served
his purpose better than words of weight and wisdom.</p>
<p>In the afternoons Mistress Brodie was to visit,
and the winter in Edinburgh to talk over. Coming
home in time to take tea with her grandfather,
she devoted the first hour after the meal to practising
her best songs, and these lullabyed the old
man to a sleep which often lasted until &#8220;The
Banded Men&#8221; were attended to. It might then be
ten o&#8217;clock and she was ready to sleep.</p>
<p>All through these long summer days, Thora was
the natural source of interest and the inciting element
of all the work and chatter that turned the
Ragnor house upside down and inside out; but
Thora was naturally shy and quiet, and Sunna
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
naturally expressive and presuming; and it was
difficult for their companions to keep Thora and
Sunna in their proper places. Every one found
it difficult. Only when Ian was present, did Sunna
take her proper secondary place and Ian, though
the most faithful and attentive of lovers by mail,
had only been able to pay Thora one personal
visit. This visit had occurred at the end of June
and he was expected again at the end of September.
The year was now approaching that time and
the Ragnor household was in a state of happy expectation.</p>
<p>It was an unusual condition and Sunna said irritably:
&#8220;They go on about this stranger as if he
were the son of Jupiter&ndash;&ndash;and poor Boris! They
never mention him, though there has been a big
battle and Boris may have been in it. If Boris
were killed, it is easy to see that this Ian Macrae
would step into his place!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of that kind could happen! In thy
own heart keep such foolish thoughts,&#8221; replied
Vedder.</p>
<p>So the last days of September were restless and
not very happy, for there was a great storm prevailing,
and the winds roared and the rain fell in
torrents and the sea looked as if it had gone mad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Before the storm there was a report of a big battle,
but no details of it had reached them. For
the Pentland Firth had been in its worst equinoctial
temper and the proviso added to all Orkney
sailing notices, &#8220;weather permitting,&#8221; had been in
full force for nearly a week.</p>
<p>But at length the storm was over and everyone
was on the lookout for the delayed shipping.
Thora was pale with intense excitement but all
things were in beautiful readiness for the expected
guest. And Ian did not disappoint the
happy hopes which called him. He was on the
first ship that arrived and it was Conall Ragnor&#8217;s
hand he clasped as his feet touched the dry
land.</p>
<p>Such a home-coming as awaited him&ndash;&ndash;the cheerful
room, the bountifully spread table, the warm
welcome, the beauty and love, mingling with that
sense of peace and rest and warm affection which
completely satisfies the heart. Would such a blissful
hour ever come again to him in this life?</p>
<p>His pockets were full of newspapers, and they
were all shouting over the glorious opening of the
war. The battle of Alma had been fought and
won; and the troops were ready and waiting for
Inkerman. England&#8217;s usual calm placidity had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
vanished in exultant rejoicing. &#8220;An English gentleman
told me,&#8221; said Ian, &#8220;that you could not escape
the chimes of joyful bells in any part of the
ringing island.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vedder had just entered the room and he stood
still to listen to these words. Then he said: &#8220;Men
differ. For the first victory let all the bells of
England ring if they want to. We Norsemen like
to keep our bell-ringing until the fight is over and
they can chime <i>Peace</i>. And how do you suppose,
Ian Macrae, that the English and French will
like to fight together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well enough, sir, no doubt. Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Waterloo I was thinking. Have the
French forgotten it? Ian, it is the very first time
in all the history we have, that Frenchmen ever
fought with Englishmen in a common cause. Natural
enemies they have been for centuries, fighting
each other with a very good will whenever
they got a chance. Have they suddenly become
friends? Have they forgot Waterloo?&#8221; and he
shook his wise old head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can tell, sir, but when the English conquer
any nation, they feel kindly to them and
usually give them many favours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, every one knows that the same is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
both her pleasure and her folly; and dearly she
pays for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ian,&#8221; said Mistress Ragnor, &#8220;are the English
ships now in the Black Sea? And if so, do you
think Boris is with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About Boris, I do not know. He told me he
was carrying &#8216;material of war.&#8217; The gentleman
of whom I spoke went down to Spithead to see
them off. Her Majesty, in the royal yacht, <i>Fairy</i>,
suddenly appeared. Then the flagship hauled
home every rope by the silent &#8216;all-at-once&#8217; action
of one hundred men. Immediately the rigging of
the ships was black with sailors, but there was not
a sound heard except an occasional command&ndash;&ndash;sharp,
short and imperative&ndash;&ndash;or the shrill order
of the boatswain&#8217;s whistle. The next moment,
the Queen&#8217;s yacht shot past the fleet and literally
led it out to sea. Near the Nab, the royal yacht
hove to and the whole fleet sailed past her, carried
swiftly out by a fine westerly breeze. Her
Majesty waved her handkerchief as they passed
and it is said she wept. If she had not wept she
would have been less than a woman and a
queen.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Vedder and Ragnor were discussing this
incident, and comparing it with Cleopatra at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
head of her fleet and Boadicea at the head of her
British army and Queen Elizabeth at Tewksbury
reviewing her army, Mrs. Ragnor and Thora left
the room. Ian quickly followed. There was a
bright fire in the parlour, and the piano was open.
Ian naturally drifted there and then Thora&#8217;s voice
was wanted in the song. When it was finished,
Mrs. Ragnor had been called out and they were
alone. And though Mrs. Ragnor came back at
intervals, they were practically alone during the
rest of the evening.</p>
<p>What do lovers talk about when they are alone?
Ah! their conversation is not to be written down.
How unwritable it is! How wise it is! How
foolish when written down! How supremely satisfying
to the lovers themselves! Surely it is only
the &#8220;baby-talk&#8221; of the wisdom not yet comprehensible
to human hearts! We often say of certain
events; &#8220;I have no words to describe what I
felt&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and who will find out or invent the heavenly
syllables that can adequately describe the divine
passion of two souls, that suddenly find their
real mate&ndash;&ndash;find the soul that halves their soul,
created for them, created with them, often lost or
missed through diverse reincarnations; but sooner
or later found again and known as soon as found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
to both. No wooing is necessary in such a case&ndash;&ndash;they
meet, they look, they love, and naturally and
immediately take up their old, but unforgotten
love patois. They do not need to learn its sweet,
broken syllables, its hand clasps and sighs, its
glances and kisses; they are more natural to them
than was the grammared language they learned
through years of painful study.</p>
<p>Ian and Thora hardly knew how the week went.
Every one respected their position and left them
very much to their own inclinations. It led them
to long, solitary walks, and to the little green skiff
on the moonlit bay, and to short visits to Sunna,
in order, mainly, that they might afterwards tell
each other how far sweeter and happier they were
alone.</p>
<p>They never tired of each other, and every day
they recounted the number of days that had to
pass ere Ian could call himself free from the McLeod
contract. They were to marry immediately
and Ian would go into Ragnor&#8217;s business as bookkeeper.
Their future home was growing more
beautiful every day. It was going to be the prettiest
little home on the island. There was a good
garden attached to it and a small greenhouse to
save the potted plants in the winter. Ragnor had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
ordered its furniture from a famous maker in
Aberdeen, and Rahal was attending with love and
skill to all those incidentals of modern housekeeping,
usually included in such words as silver,
china, napery, ornaments, and kitchen-utensils.
They were much interested in it and went every
fine day to observe its progress. Yet their interest
in the house was far inferior to their interest
in each other, and Sunna may well be excused for
saying to her grandfather:</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the most conceited couple in the
world! In fact, the world belongs to them and
all the men and women in it&ndash;&ndash;the sun and the
moon are made new for them, and they have the
only bit of wisdom going. I hope I may be able
to say &#8216;yes&#8217; to all they claim until Saturday
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the ways of love, Sunna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall not walk in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt walk in the way appointed thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pure Calvinism is that, Grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So be it. I am a Calvinist about birth, death
and marriage. They are the events in life about
which God interferes. His will and design is
generally evident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And quite as evident, Grandfather, is the fact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
that a great many people interfere with His will
and design.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sunna, because our will is free. Yet if
our will crosses God&#8217;s will, crucifixion of some kind
is sure to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, today is Friday. The week has
got itself over nearly; and tomorrow will be partly
free, for Ian goes to Edinburgh at ten o&#8217;clock.
Very proper is that! Such an admirable young
man ought only to live in a capitol city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If these are thy opinions, keep them to thyself.
Very popular is the young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather, dost thou think that I am walking
in ankle-tights yet? I can talk as the crowd
talks, and I can talk to a sensible man like thee.
Tomorrow brings release. I am glad, for Thora
has forgotten me. I feel that very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art jealous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vedder&#8217;s assertion was near the truth, for undeniably
Ian and Thora had been careless of any
one but themselves. Yet their love was so vital
and primitive, so unaffected and sincere, that it
touched the sympathies of all. In this cold, far-northern
island, it had all the glow and warmth of
some rose-crowned garden of a tropical paradise.
But such special days are like days set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
apart; they do not fit into ordinary life and cannot
be continued long under any circumstances. So the
last day came and Thora said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, dear, it is a day in a thousand for
beauty, and we are going to get Aunt Brodie&#8217;s
carriage to ride over to Stromness and see the
queer, old town, and the Stones of Stenness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go not near them. If you go into the cathedral
you go expecting some good to come to you;
for angels may be resting in its holy aisles, ready
and glad to bless you. What will you ask of the
ghosts among the Stones of Stenness? Is there
any favour you would take from the Baal and
Moloch worshipped with fire and blood among
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mother,&#8221; said Thora, &#8220;I have known
many girls who went with their lovers to Stenness
purposely to join their hands through the hole in
Woden&#8217;s Stone and thus take oath to love each
other forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou and Ian will take that oath in the holy
church of St. Magnus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what we wish, Mother,&#8221; said Ian.
&#8220;We wish nothing less than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, go and see the queer, old, old
town, and go to the Mason&#8217;s Arms, and you will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
get there a good dinner. After it ride slowly back.
Father will be home before six and must have his
meal at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the thing we shall do, Mother. Ian
thought it would be so romantic to take a lunch
with us and eat it among the Stones of Stenness.
But the Mason&#8217;s Arms will be better. The Masons
are good men, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In all their generations, good men. Thy
father is a Mason in high standing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is so! Then the Mason&#8217;s Arms may
be lucky to us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We make things lucky or unlucky by our willing
and doing; but even so, it is not lucky to defy
or deny what the dead have once held to be good
or bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, why, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, will we talk of whys and wherefores.
It is easier to believe than to think. Take, in this
last day of Love&#8217;s seven days, the full joy of your
lives and ask not why of anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the lovers went off gaily to see the land-locked
bay and the strange old town of Stromness;
and the house was silent and lonely without
them and Rahal wished that her husband would
come home and talk with her, for her soul was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
under a cloud of presentiments and she said to
herself after a morning of fretful, inefficient work:
&#8220;Oh, how much easier it is to love God than it is
to trust Him. Are not my dear ones in His care?
Yet about them I am constantly worrying; though
perfectly well I know that in any deluge that may
come, God will find an ark for those who love
and trust Him. Boris knows&ndash;&ndash;Boris knows&ndash;&ndash;I
have told him.&#8221;</p>
<p>About three o&#8217;clock she went to the window and
looked towards the town. Much to her astonishment
she saw her husband coming home at a speed
far beyond his ordinary walk. He appeared also
to be disturbed, even angry, and she watched him
anxiously until he reached the house. Then she
was at the open door and his face frightened her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conall! My dear one! Art thou ill?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ill with anger and pity and shame!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is thy meaning? Speak to me plainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rahal! the shame and the cruelty of it! I
am beside myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to my room, then thou shalt tell thy sorrow
and I will halve it with thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I want to cry out! I want to shout the
shameful wrong from the house-tops! Indeed, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
is flying all over England and Scotland&ndash;&ndash;over all
the civilized world! And yet&ndash;&ndash;my God! the
guilty ones are still living!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coll, my dear one, what is it thou most needs&ndash;&ndash;cold
water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No! Get me a pot of hot tea.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[*]</a> My
brain burns. My heart is like to break! Our
poor brave soldiers! They are dying of hunger
and of every form of shameful neglect. The
barest necessities of life are denied them.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='fn' />
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0001' id='Footnote_0001'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0001'><span class='label'>[*]</span></a>
<p>The Norsemen of Shetland and Orkney drank tea in
every kind of need or crisis. No meal without it, no pleasure
without it; and it was equally indispensable in every kind
of trouble or fatigue.</p>
</div>
<hr class='fn' />
<p>&#8220;By whom? By whom, Coll?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pacifists in power and office everywhere! Give
me a drink! Give me a drink! I am ill&ndash;&ndash;get me
tea&ndash;&ndash;and I will tell thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was boiling water on the kitchen hob,
and the tea was ready in five minutes. &#8220;Drink,
dear Coll,&#8221; said Rahal, &#8220;and then share thy
trouble and anger with me. The mail packet
brought the bad news, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, about an hour ago. The town is in a
tumult. Men are cursing and women are doing
nothing less. Some whose sons are at the front
are in a distraction. If Aberdeen were within our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
reach we would give him five minutes to say his
prayers and then send him to the judgment of
God. Englishmen and Norsemen will not lie down
and rot under Russian tyranny. To die fighting
against it sends them joyfully to the battlefield!
But oh, Rahal! to be left alone to die on the battlefield,
without help, without care, without even
a drink of cold water! It is damnable cruelty!
What I say is this: let England stop her bell-ringing
and shouts of victory until she has comforted
and helped her wounded and dying soldiers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Aberdeen? He is a Scotch nobleman&ndash;&ndash;the
Scotch are not cowards&ndash;&ndash;what has he done,
Coll?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he hates fighting for our rights, he
persuades all whom his power and patronage can
reach to lie down or he says they will be knocked
down. So it may be, but every man that has a
particle of the Divine in him would rather be
knocked down than lie down&ndash;&ndash;if down it had to
be&ndash;&ndash;but there is no question of down in it! Aberdeen!
He is &#8216;England&#8217;s worst enemy&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;and he
holds the power given him by England to rule and
ruin England! I wish he would die and go to
judgment this night! I do! I do! and my soul
says to me, &#8216;Thou art right.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Coll, no man knoweth the will of the Almighty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they ought to! The question has now
been up to England for a two-years&#8217; discussion,
and they have only to open His Word and find it
out&#8221;; then he straightened himself and in a
mighty burst of joyful pride and enthusiasm cried
out:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth
my hands to war, and my fingers to
fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My goodness, and my fortress, my high
tower, and my deliverer, my shield, and He in
whom I trust, who subdueth the people under
me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anon he began to pace the floor as he continued:
&#8220;&#8216;Rid us and deliver us, from the hands of
strange children&ndash;&ndash;whose mouth speaketh vanity,
and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.&#8217;
Rahal, could there be a better description
of Russia&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;her right hand of falsehood, her
mouth speaking vanity?&#8217; David put the very
words needed in our mouths when he taught us
to say, &#8216;rid us of such an enemy, and of all who
strike hands with him!&#8217; Yes, rid us. We want to
be rid of all such dead souls! Rid us.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>Then Rahal reminded her husband that only recently
his physician had warned him against all excitement,
especially of anger, and so finally induced
him to take a sedative and go to sleep. But
sleep was far from her. She sat down in her own
room and closed her eyes against all worldly
sights and sounds. Her soul was trying to reach
her son&#8217;s soul and impress upon it her own trust
in the love and mercy of the &#8220;God of battles.&#8221;
She had hoped that some word or thought of
Boris would come back to her in such a personal
manner that she would feel that he was thinking
of her and of the many sweet spiritual confidences
they had had together.</p>
<p>But nothing came, no sign, no word, no sudden,
flashing memory of some special promise. All
was void and still until she heard the voices of
Thora and Ian. Then she went down to them
and found that the evil news had met them on
their way home. She asked Ian if he had any
knowledge of the whereabouts of Boris. Ian
thought he might be at sea, as his ship was at Spithead
among the carrying ships of the navy. &#8220;If
he had been in Alma&#8217;s fight, you might have
heard from him,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It would
be his first battle and he would want to write
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
to you about it. That would be only natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I will look for good news. If bad
news is coming, I will not pay it the compliment
of going to meet it. Have you had a pleasant
day? Where first did you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the land-locked Bay of Stromness which
was full of ships of all sizes, of schooners, and of
little skiffs painted a light green colour like the
pleasure skiffs of Kirkwall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was very busy while we were there. It has
but one long street, with steep branches running
directly up the big granite hill which shelters it
from the Atlantic. What I noticed particularly
was, that the houses on the main street all had
their gables seaward; and are so built that the
people can step from their doors into their boats.
I liked that arrangement. Stromness is really an
Orcadean Venice. The town is a queer old place,
with a non-English and non-Scotch look. The
houses have an old-world appearance and the
names over the doorways carry you back to Norseland.
Only one street is flagged and little bays
run up into the street through its whole length.
But the place appeared to be very busy and happy.
I noticed few Scotch there, the people seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
be purely Norse. All were busy&ndash;&ndash;men, women
and children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be the last port for the Hudson Bay
Company,&#8221; said Rahal, &#8220;and the big whaling
fleets, and in days of war and convoys there were
hundreds of big ships in its wonderful harbour. I
suppose that you had no time to visit any of the
ancient monuments there?&#8221; Rahal asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Thora told me her grandmother Ragnor
was buried in its cemetery and that her grave was
near the church door and had a white pillar at the
head of it. So we walked there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot describe to you the savage, lonely
grandeur of its situation. It frightened me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The men and women who chose it were not
afraid of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora says its memory frightened her for
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thora was only eight years old when her
father placed the pillar at the head of his mother&#8217;s
grave. It was then she saw it&ndash;&ndash;but at eight
years many people are often more sensitive than
at eighty. Yes, indeed! They may see, then, what
eyes dimmed by earthly vision cannot see, and feel
what hearts hardened by earth&#8217;s experiences cannot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
feel. Thora&#8217;s spiritual sight was very keen in
childhood and is not dimmed yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>At these words Thora entered the room, wearing
the little frock of white bar&eacute;ge she had saved
for this last day of Ian&#8217;s visit. Her face had been
bathed, her hair brushed and loosened but yet
dressed with the easiest simplicity. She was in
trouble but she knew when to speak of trouble,
and when to be silent. Her mother was talking
of Stromness; when her father came, he would
know all, and say all. So she went softly about
the room, putting on the dinner table those last
final accessories that it was her duty to supply.</p>
<p>Yet the conversation was careless and indifferent.
Rahal talked of Stromness but her heart
was far away from Stromness, and Thora would
have liked to tell her mother how beautifully their
future home had been papered, and all three were
eager to discuss the news that had come. But all
knew well that it would be better not to open the
discussion till Ragnor was present to inform and
direct their ignorance of events.</p>
<p>On the stroke of six, Ragnor entered. He had
slept and washed and was apparently calm, but
in some way his face had altered, for his heart
had mastered his brain and its usual expression of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
intellectual strength was exchanged for one of intense
feeling. His eyes shone and he had the look
of a man who had just come from the presence
of God.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are waiting for you, dear Coll,&#8221; said Rahal;
and he answered softly: &#8220;Well, then, I am
here.&#8221; For a moment his eyes rested on the table
which Rahal had set with extra care and with the
delicacies Ian liked best. Was it not the last dinner
he would eat with them for three months?
She thought it only kind to give it a little distinction.
But this elaboration of the usual home blessings
did not produce the expected results. Every
one was anxious, the atmosphere of the room was
tense and was not relieved until Ragnor had said
a grace full of meaning and had sat down and
asked Ian if he &#8220;had heard the news brought by
that day&#8217;s packet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very brokenly, Father,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;Two men, whom we met on the Stromness road,
told us that it was &#8216;bad with the army,&#8217; but they
were excited and in a great hurry and would not
stand to answer our questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder! No wonder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever is the matter, Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you. The words stumble in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
throat, and my heart burns and bleeds. Here is
the <i>London Times</i>! Read aloud from it what
William Howard Russell has witnessed&ndash;&ndash;I cannot
read the words&ndash;&ndash;I would be using my own
words&ndash;&ndash;listen, Rahal! Listen, Thora! and oh,
may God enter into judgment at once with the men
responsible for the misery that Russell tells us of.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, Adam Vedder entered the room.
He was in a passion that was relieving itself by
a torrent of low voiced curses&ndash;&ndash;curses only just
audible but intensely thrilling in their half-whispered
tones of passion. In the hall he had taken
off his hat but on entering the room he found it
too warm for his top-coat, and he began to remove
it, muttering to himself while so doing. There
was an effort to hear what he was saying but very
quickly Ragnor stopped the monologue by calling:</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam! Thee! Thou art the one wanted.
Ian is just going to read what the <i>London Times</i>
says of this dreadful mismanagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mismanagement!&#8217; Is that what thou calls
the crime? Go on, Ian! More light on this subject
is wanted here.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Ian stood up and read from the <i>Times&#8217;</i> correspondent&#8217;s
letter the following sentences:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The skies are black as ink, the wind is howling over
the staggering tents, the water is sometimes a foot
deep, our men have neither warm nor waterproof
clothing and we are twelve hours at a time in the
trenches&ndash;&ndash;and not a soul seems to care for their comfort
or even their lives; the most wretched beggar who
wanders about the streets of London in the rain leads
the life of a prince compared with the British soldiers
now fighting out here for their country.</p>
<p>... &#8220;The commonest accessories of a hospital are
wanting; there is not the least attention paid to decency
or cleanliness, the stench is appalling, the fetid
air can barely struggle out through chinks in the walls
and roofs, and for all I can observe the men die without
the least effort being made to save them. They
lie just as they were let down on the ground by the
poor fellows, their comrades, who brought them on
their backs from the camp with the greatest tenderness
but who are not allowed to remain with them.
The sick appear to be tended by the sick, and the
dying by the dying. There are no nurses&ndash;&ndash;and men
are literally dying hourly, because the medical staff of
the British army has forgotten that old rags of linen
are necessary for the dressing of wounds.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; cried Ian, as he let the paper fall
from the hands he clasped passionately together,
&#8220;My God! How can Thou permit this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, young man,&#8221; said Adam, &#8220;thou
must remember that God permits what He does
not will. And Conall,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;millions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
have been voted and spent for war and hospital
materials, where are the goods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain of the packet told me no one could
get their hands on them. Some are in the holds
of vessels and other things so piled on the top of
them that they cannot be got at till the hold is
regularly emptied. Some are stored in warehouses
which no one has authority to open&ndash;&ndash;some
are actually rotting on the open wharves, because
the precise order to remove them to the hospital
cannot be found. The surgeons have no bandages,
the doctors no medicine, and as I said there
are no nurses but a few rough military orderlies.
The situation paralyses those who see it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paralyses! Pure nonsense!&#8221; cried Vedder,
whose face was wet with passionate tears, though
he did not know it. &#8220;Paralyses! No, no! It
must make them work miracles. I am going to
Edinburgh tomorrow. I am going to buy all the
luxuries and medicines I can afford for the lads
fighting and suffering. Sunna is going to spend a
week in gathering old linen in Kirkwall and then
Mistress Brodie and she will bring it with them.
Rahal, Thora, you must do your best. And thou,
Conall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam, thou can open my purse and take all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
thou thinks is right. My Boris may be among
those dear lads; his mother will have something
to send him. Wilt thou see it is set on a fair way
to reach his hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take it to him. If he be in London with
his vessel, I will find him; if he be at the front, I
will find him. If he be in Scutari hospital, I will
find him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Adam, Adam!&#8221; cried Rahal, &#8220;thou art the
good man that God loves, the man after His own
heart.&#8221; Her face was set and stern and white
as snow, and Thora&#8217;s was a duplicate of it; but
Ragnor, during his short interval of rest, had arrived
at that heighth and depth of confidence in
God&#8217;s wisdom which made him sure that in the end
the folly and wickedness of men would &#8220;praise
Him&#8221;; so he was ready to help, and calm and
strong in his sorrow.</p>
<p>At this point, Rahal rose and a servant came in
and began to clear the table and carry away the
remains of the meal. Then Rahal rose and took
Thora&#8217;s hand and Ian went with them to the parlour.
She spoke kindly to Ian who at her first
words burst into bitter weeping, into an almost
womanly burst of uncontrollable distress. So she
kissed and left him with the only woman who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
the power to soothe, in any degree, the sense of
utter helplessness which oppressed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go to the Crimea!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
would gladly go there. It would give me a chance
to die happily. It would repay me for all my
miserable life. I want to go, Thora. You
want me to go, Thora! Yes, you do, dear
one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not want you to go. I want you here.
Oh, what a selfish coward I am. Go, Ian, if you
wish&ndash;&ndash;if you feel it right to go, then go.&#8221;</p>
<p>This subject was sufficient to induce a long and
strange conversation during which Thora was led
to understand that some great and cruel circumstances
had ruined and in some measure yet controlled
her lover&#8217;s life. She was begging him to
go and talk to her father and tell him all that
troubled him so cruelly when Rahal entered the
room again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear ones,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the house is cold and
the lamps nearly out. Say good night, now. Ian
must be up early&ndash;&ndash;and tomorrow we shall have a
busy day collecting all the old linen we can.&#8221; She
was yet as white as the long dressing gown she
wore but there was a smile on her face that made
it lovely as she recited slowly:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Watching, wondering, yearning, knowing<br />
Whence the stream, and where &#8217;tis going<br />
Seems all mystery&ndash;&ndash;by and by<br />
He will speak, and tell us why.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And the simple words had a charm in them, and
though they said &#8220;Good night,&#8221; in a mist of tears,
the sunshine of hope turned them into that wonderful
bow which God &#8216;bended with his hands&#8217;
and placed in the heavens as a token of His covenant
with man, that He would always remember
man&#8217;s weakness and give him help in time of
trouble. Now let every good man and woman
say &#8220;I&#8217;ll warrant it! I never yet found a deluge
of any kind but I found also that God had provided
an ark for my refuge and my comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> next night Vedder went away. His purposes
were necessarily rather vague, but it
was certain he would go to the front if he thought
he could do any good there. He talked earnestly
and long with Ragnor but when it came to parting,
both men were strangely silent. They clasped
hands and looked long and steadily into each other&#8217;s
eyes. No words could interpret that look. It
was a conversation for eternity.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the whole town was eager to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
do something but what could they do that would
give the immediate relief that was needed? There
were no sewing machines then, women&#8217;s fingers
and needles could not cope with the difficulty, even
regarding the Orkney men who were suffering.
To gather from every one the very necessary old
linen seemed to be the very extent of their usefulness.</p>
<p>In these first days of the trouble, Rahal and
Thora were serious and quiet. A dull, inexplicable
melancholy shrouded the girl like a garment.
The pretty home preparing for Ian and herself
lost its interest. She refused to look forward and
lived only in the unhappy present. The few words
Ian has said about some wrong or trouble in the
past years of his life overshadowed her. She was
naturally very prescient and her higher self dwelt
much in</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>... that finer atmosphere,<br />
Where footfalls of appointed things,<br />

<p>However, if trouble lasts through the night, joy,
or at least hope and expectation, comes in the
morning; and certainly the first shock of grief settled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
down into patient hoping and waiting. Vedder
and Ian were both good correspondents and
the silence and loneliness were constantly broken
by their interesting letters. And joyful or sorrowful,
Time goes by.</p>
<p>Sunna wrote occasionally but she said she found
Edinburgh dull, and that she would gladly return
to Kirkwall if it was not for the Pentland
Firth and its winter tempers and tantrums.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The war [she added] has stopped all balls and even
house parties. There is no dancing and no sports of
any kind, and I believe skating and golf have been
forbidden. Love-making is the only recreation allowed
and I am not tempted to sin in this direction.
The churches are always open and their bells clatter
all day long. I have no lovers. Every man will talk
of the war, and then they get offended if you ask
them why they are not gone. I have had the pleasure
of saying a few painful truths to these feather-bed
patriots, and they tell each other, no doubt, that I am
impossible and impertinent. One of them said to me,
myself: &#8220;Wait a wee, Miss Vedder, I wouldna wonder
but some crippled war lad will fa&#8217; to your lot, when the
puir fellows come marching home again.&#8221; The Edinburgh
men are just city flunkeys, they would do fine to
wait on our Norse men. I would like well to see a
little dandy advocate I know here, trotting after Boris.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So days came and went, and the passion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
shame and sorrow died down and people did not
talk of the war. But the doors of St. Magnus
stood open all day long and there were always
women praying there. They had begun to carry
their anxieties and griefs to God; and that was
well for God did not weary of their complaining.
Women have the very heart of sympathy for a
man&#8217;s griefs. God is the only refuge for a sorrowful
woman.</p>
<p>Steadily the preparations for Thora&#8217;s marriage
went on, but the spirit that animated their first
beginnings had cooled down into that calm necessity,
which always has to attend to all &#8220;finishings
off.&#8221; Early in December, Thora&#8217;s future home
was quite finished, and this last word expresses its
beauty and completeness. Then Ragnor kissed
his daughter, and put into her hand the key of the
house and the deed of gift which made it her own
forever. And in this same hour they decided that
the first day of the New Year should be the wedding
day; for Bishop Hedley would then be in
Kirkwall and who else could marry the little Thora
whom he had baptised and confirmed and welcomed
into the fold of the church.</p>
<p>Nothing is more remarkable than the variety of
moods in which women take the solemn initiatory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
rite ushering them into their real life and their
great and honourable duties. Thora was joyful as
a bird in spring and never weary of examining the
lovely home, the perfect wardrobe, and the great
variety of beautiful presents that had been given
her.</p>
<p>Very soon it was the twentieth of December,
and Ian was expected on the twenty-third. Christmas
preparations had now taken the place of marriage
preparations for every item was ready for
the latter event. There had been a little anxiety
about the dress and veil, but they arrived on the
morning of the twentieth and were beautiful and
fitting in every respect. The dress was of the
orthodox white satin and the veil fell from a
wreath of orange flowers and myrtle leaves. And
oh, how proud and happy Thora was in their
possession. Several times that wonderful day she
had run secretly to her room to examine and admire
them.</p>
<p>On the morning of the twenty-first she reminded
herself that in two days Ian would be with
her and that in nine days she would be his wife.
She was genuine and happy about the event. She
made no pretences or reluctances. She loved Ian
with all her heart, she was glad she was going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
to be always with him. Life would then be full
and she would be the happiest woman in the
world. She asked her father at the breakfast
table to send her, at once, any letters that might
come for her in his mail. &#8220;I am sure there will
be one from Ian,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and, dear Father,
it hurts me to keep it waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>About ten o&#8217;clock, Mrs. Beaton called and
brought Thora a very handsome ring from Maximus
Grant and a bracelet from herself. She
stayed to lunch with the Ragnors and after the
meal was over, they went upstairs to look at the
wedding dress. &#8220;I want to see it on you, Thora,&#8221;
said Mrs. Beaton, &#8220;I shall have a wedding dress
to buy for my niece soon and I would like to know
what kind of a fit Mrs. Scott achieves.&#8221; So Thora
put on the dress, and Mrs. Beaton admitted that it
&#8220;fit like a glove&#8221; and that she should insist on her
niece Helen going to Mrs. Scott.</p>
<p>With many scattering, delaying remarks and
good wishes, the lady finally bid Thora good-bye
and Mrs. Ragnor went downstairs with her. Then
Thora eagerly lifted two letters that had come in
her father&#8217;s mail and been sent home to her. One
was from Ian. &#8220;The last he will write to Thora
Ragnor,&#8221; she said with a smile. &#8220;I will put it with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
his first letter and keep them all my life long. So
loving is he, so good, so handsome! There is no
one like my Ian.&#8221; Twice over she read his loving
letter and then laid it down and lifted the one
which had come with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean Hay,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;who is Jean Hay?&#8221;
Then she remembered the writer&ndash;&ndash;an orphan girl
living with a married brother who did not always
treat her as kindly as he should have done. Hearing
and believing this story, Rahal Ragnor hired
the girl, taught her how to sew, how to mend and
darn and in many ways use her needle. Then discovering
that she had a genius for dressmaking,
she placed her with a first-class modiste in Edinburgh
to be properly instructed and liberally attended
to all financial requisites; for Rahal Ragnor
could not do anything unless it was wholly and
perfectly done. Then Thora had dressed Jean
from her own wardrobe and asked her father to
send their proteg&eacute;e to Edinburgh on one of the
vessels he controlled. And Jean had been heartily
grateful, had done well, and risen to a place of
trust in her employer&#8217;s business; and a few times
every year she wrote to Mrs. Ragnor or Thora.
All these circumstances were remembered by
Thora in a moment. &#8220;Jean Hay!&#8221; she exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
&#8220;Well, Jean, you must wait a few minutes,
until I have taken off my wedding dress. I
am sorry I had to put it on&ndash;&ndash;it was not very kind
or thoughtful of Mrs. Beaton to ask me&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t
believe mother liked her doing so&ndash;&ndash;mother has
a superstition or fret about everything. Well,
then, it is no way spoiled&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; and she lifted it
and the white silk petticoat belonging to the dress
and carefully put them in the place Rahal had selected
as the safest for their keeping. It was a
large closet in the spare room and she went there
with them. As she returned to her own room she
heard her mother welcoming a favourite visitor
and it pleased her. &#8220;Now I need not hurry,&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;Mistress Vorn will stay an hour at
least, and I can take my own time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking her own time&#8221; evidently meant to
Thora the reading of Ian&#8217;s letter over again.
And also a little musing on what Ian had said.
There was, however, no hurry about Jean Hay&#8217;s
letter and it was so pleasant to drift among the
happy thoughts that crowded into her consideration.
So for half an hour Jean&#8217;s letter lay at her
side untouched&ndash;&ndash;Jean was so far outside her
dreams and hopes that afternoon&ndash;&ndash;but at length
she lifted it and these were the words she read:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Miss Thora:</span></p>
<p>I was hearing since last spring that thou wert going
to be married on the son of the Rev. Dr. Macrae&ndash;&ndash;on
the young man called John Calvin Macrae. Very
often I was hearing this, and always I was answering,
&#8220;There will be no word of truth in that story. Miss
Ragnor will not be noticing such a young man as
that. No, indeed!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Thora threw down the letter and sat looking
at it upon the floor as if she would any moment
tear it to pieces. But she did not, she finally lifted
it and forced herself to continue reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was hating to tell thee some things I knew, and I
was often writing and then tearing up my letter, for it
made me sick to be thy true friend in such a cruel way.
But often I have heard the wise tell &#8220;when the knife is
needed, the salve pot will be of no use.&#8221; Now then,
this day, I tell myself with a sad heart, &#8220;Jean, thou
must take the knife. The full time has come.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Why won&#8217;t the woman tell what she has got
to tell,&#8221; said Thora in a voice of impatient anguish,
and in a few minutes she whispered, &#8220;I am cold.&#8221;
Then she threw a knitted cape over her shoulders
and lifted the letter again, oh, so reluctantly, and
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The young man will have told your father, that he
is McLeod&#8217;s agent and a sort of steward of his large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
properties. This does not sound like anything wrong,
but often I have been told different. Old McLeod
left to his son many houses. Three of them are not
good houses, they are really fashionable gambling
houses. Macrae has the management of them as well
as of many others in various parts of the city. Of
these others I have heard no wrong. I suppose they
may be quite respectable.</p>
<p>This story has more to it. Whenever there is a
great horse race there Macrae will be, and I saw
myself in the daily newspapers that his name was
among the winners on the horse Sergius. It was only
a small sum he won, but sin is not counted in pounds
and shillings. No, indeed! So there is no wonder his
good father is feeling the shame of it.</p>
<p>Moreover, though he calls himself Ian, that is not
his name. His name is John Calvin and his denial of
his baptismal name, given to him at the Sabbath service,
in the house of God, at the very altar of the same,
is thought by some to be a denial of God&#8217;s grace and
mercy. And he has been reasoned with on this matter
by the ruling elder in his father&#8217;s kirk, but no reason
would he listen to, and saying many things about Calvin
I do not care to write.</p>
<p>Many stories go about young men and young women,
and there is this and that said about Macrae. I have
myself met him on Prince&#8217;s Street in the afternoon
very often, parading there with various gayly dressed
women. I do not blame him much for that. The
Edinburgh girls are very forward, not like the Norse
girls, who are modest and retiring in their ways. I
am forced to say that Macrae is a very gay young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
man, and of course you know all that means without
more words about it. He dresses in the highest
fashion, goes constantly to theatres with some lady or
other, and I do not wonder that people ask, &#8220;Where
does he get the money? Does he gamble for it?&#8221; For
he does not go to any kirk on the Sabbath unless he
is paid to go there and sing, which he does very well,
people say. In his own rooms he is often heard playing
the piano and singing music that is not sacred or
fit for the holy day. And his father is the most religious
man in Edinburgh. It is just awful! I fear
you will never forgive me, Miss Thora, but I have
still more and worse to tell you, because it is, as I
may say, personally heard and not this or that body&#8217;s
clash-ma-claver. Nor did I seek the same, it came
to me through my daily work and in a way special and
unlooked-for, so that after hearing it, my conscience
would no longer be satisfied and I was forced, as it
were, to the writing of this letter to you.</p>
<p>I dare say Macrae may have spoken to you anent
his friendship with Agnes and Willie Henderson, indeed
Willie Henderson and John Macrae have been
finger and thumb ever since they played together.
Now Willie&#8217;s father is an elder in Dr. Macrae&#8217;s kirk
and if all you hear anent him be true&ndash;&ndash;which I cannot
vouch for&ndash;&ndash;he is a man well regarded both in kirk and
market place&ndash;&ndash;that is, he was so regarded until he
married again about two years ago. For who, think
you, should he marry but a proud upsetting Englishwoman,
who was bound to be master and mistress
both o&#8217;er the hale household?</p>
<p>Then Miss Henderson showed fight and her brother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Willie stood by her. And Miss Henderson is a spunky
girl and thought bonnie by some people, and has a
tongue so well furnished with words to defend what
she thinks her rights, that it leaves nobody uncertain
as to what thae rights may be. Weel, there has been
nothing but quarreling in the elder&#8217;s house ever since
the unlucky wedding; and in the first year of the
trial Willie Henderson borrowed money&ndash;&ndash;I suppose of
John Macrae&ndash;&ndash;and took himself off to America, and
some said the elder was glad of it and others said he
was sair down-hearted and disappointed.</p>
<p>After that, Miss Agnes was never friends with her
stepmother. It seems the woman wanted her to marry
a nephew of her ain kith and kin, and in this matter
her father was of the same mind. The old man doubtless
wanted a sough of peace in his own home. That
was how things stood a couple of weeks syne, but
yestreen I heard what may make the change wanted.
This is how it happened.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Baird came to Madame
David&#8217;s to have a black velvet gown fitted. Madame
called on Jean Hay to attend her in the fitting and
to hang the long skirt properly&ndash;&ndash;for it is a difficult
job to hang a velvet skirt, and Jean Hay is thought to
be very expert anent the set and swing of silk velvet,
which has a certain contrariness of its own. Let that
pass. I was kneeling on the floor, setting the train,
when Mrs. Baird said: &#8220;I suppose you have heard,
Madame, the last escapade of that wild son of the
great Dr. Macrae?&#8221; Then I was all ears, the more so
when I heard Madam say: &#8220;I heard a whisper of
something, but I was not heeding it. Folks never seem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
to weary of finding fault with the handsome lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Madame,&#8221; said Mrs. Baird, &#8220;I happen to
know about this story. Seeing with your own eyes is
believing, surely!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you see?&#8221; Madame asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw enough to satisfy me. You know my house
is opposite to the West End Hotel, and last Friday I
saw Macrae go there and he was dressed up to the
nines. He went in and I felt sure he had gone to call
on some lady staying there. So I watched, and better
watched, for he did not come out for two hours, and
I concluded they had lunched together! For when
Macrae came out of the hotel, he spoke to a cabman,
and then waited until a young lady and her maid appeared.
He put the young lady into the cab, had a
few minutes&#8217; earnest conversation with her, then the
maid joined her mistress and they two drove away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, Mrs. Baird,&#8221; said Madame, &#8220;there was
nothing in that but just a courteous luncheon together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Madame! I felt there was more, so I took
a book and sat down by my window. And just on the
edge of the dark I saw the two women return, and a
little later a waiter put lights in an upper parlour and
he spread a table for dinner there and Macrae and
the young lady ate it together. Afterwards they went
away in a cab together.&#8221; Then Madame asked if the
maid was with them, and Mrs. Baird said she thought
she was but had not paid particular attention.</p>
<p>Madame said something to me about the length of
the train and then Mrs. Baird seemed annoyed at her
inattention, and she added: &#8220;Macrae was advertised
to sing in the City Hall the next night at a mass meeting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
of citizens about abrogating slavery in the United
States, and he was not there&ndash;&ndash;broke his engagement!
What do you think of that? The next night, Sabbath,
he did the same to Dr. Fraser&#8217;s kirk, where he had
promised to sing a pro-Christmas canticle. And this
morning I heard that he is going to the Orkneys to
marry a rich and beautiful girl who lives there. Now
what do you think of your handsome Macrae? I can
tell you he is on every one&#8217;s tongue.&#8221; And Madame
said, &#8220;I have no doubt of it and I&#8217;ll warrant nobody
knows what they are talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this the fitting on was not pleasant and I finished
my part of it as quickly as possible. Indeed,
Miss Thora, I was miserable about you and so pressed
in spirit to tell you these things that I could hardly
finish my day&#8217;s work. For my conscience kept urging
me to do my duty to you, for it is many favours you
have done me in the past. Kindly pardon me now,
and believe me,</p>

</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter Thora read to the last word but she
was nearly blind when she reached it. All her
senses rang inward. &#8220;I am dying!&#8221; she thought,
and she tried to reach the bed but only succeeded
in stumbling against a small table full of books,
knocking it down and falling with it.</p>
<p>Mistress Ragnor and her visitor heard the fall
and they were suddenly silent. Immediately, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
they went to the foot of the stairway and
called, &#8220;Thora.&#8221; There was no answer, and the
mother&#8217;s heart sank like lead, as she hastened to
her daughter&#8217;s room and threw open the door.
Then she saw her stricken child, lying as if dead
upon the floor. Cries and calls and hurrying feet
followed, and the unconscious girl was quickly
freed from all physical restraints and laid at the
open window. But all the ordinary household
methods of restoring consciousness were tried
without avail and the case began to assume a dangerous
aspect.</p>
<p>At this moment Ragnor arrived. He knelt at
his child&#8217;s side and drew her closer and closer,
whispering her name with the name of the Divine
One; and surely it was in response to his heart-breaking
entreaties the passing soul listened and
returned. &#8220;Father,&#8221; was the first whisper she uttered;
and with a glowing, grateful heart, the
father lifted her in his arms and laid her on her
bed.</p>
<p>Then Rahal gave him the two letters and sent
him away. Thora was still &#8220;far off,&#8221; or she would
have remembered her letters but it was near the
noon of the next day when she asked her mother
where they were.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thy father has them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, so sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all she said but the subject appeared
to distress her for she closed her eyes, and Rahal
kissed away the tears that slowly found their way
down the white, stricken face. However, from
this hour she rallied and towards night fell into a
deep sleep which lasted for fourteen hours; and it
was during this anxious period of waiting that
Ragnor talked to his wife about the letters which
were, presumably, the cause of the trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those letters I gave thee, Coll, did thou read
both of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of them I read. Ian&#8217;s was the happy letter
of an expectant bridegroom. Only joy and
hope was in it. It was the other one that was a
death blow. Yes, indeed, it was a bad, cruel letter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the name? Who wrote it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean Hay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean Hay! What could Jean have to do with
Thora&#8217;s affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, her conscience made her interfere.
She had heard some evil reports about Ian&#8217;s
life and she thought it her duty, after yours and
Thora&#8217;s kindness to her, to report these stories.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A miserable return for our kindness! This is
what I notice&ndash;&ndash;when people want to say cruel
things, they always blame their conscience or their
duty for making them do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is Jean&#8217;s letter. Thou, thyself, must
read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahal read it with constantly increasing anger
and finally threw it on the table with passionate
scorn. &#8220;Not one word of this stuff do I believe,
Coll! Envy and jealousy sent that news, not gratitude
and good will! No, indeed! But I will tell
thee, Coll, one thing I have always found sure, it
is this; that often, much evil comes to the good
from taking people out of their poverty and misfortunes.
They are paying a debt they owe from
the past and if we assume that debt we have it to
pay in some wise. That is the wisdom of the old,
the wisdom learned by sad experience. I wish,
then, that I had let the girl pay her own debt and
carry her own burden. She is envious of Thora.
Yet was Thora very good to her. Do I believe in
her gratitude? Not I! Had she done this cruel
thing out of a kind heart, she would have sent this
letter to me and left the telling or the not telling to
my love and best judgment. I will not believe anything
against Ian Macrae! Nothing at all!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Much truth is in thy words, Rahal, and it is
not on Jean Hay&#8217;s letter I will do anything. I
will take only Ian&#8217;s &#8216;yes,&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; on any accusation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may do that safely, Coll, I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I will go back to Edinburgh with him and
see his father. Perhaps we have all taken the
youth too far on his handsome person and his
sweet amiability.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wrote to his father when Thora was engaged
to him, with thy permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What said his father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too little! He was cursed short about all I
named. I told him Thora was good and fair and
well educated; and that she would have her full
share in my estate. I told him all that I intended
to do for them about their home and the place
which I intended for Ian in my business, and referred
him to Bishop Hedley as to my religious,
financial, social and domestic standing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did thou name Bishop Hedley to him?
They are as far apart as Leviticus and St. John.
And what did he say to thee in reply?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That my kindness was more than his son deserved,
etc. In response to our invitation to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
present at the marriage ceremony, he said it was
quite impossible, the journey was too long and
doubtful, especially in the winter; that he was subject
to sea-sickness and did not like to leave his
congregation over Sunday. Rahal, I felt the
paper on which his letter was written crinkling and
crackling in my hand, it was that stiff with ecclesiastic
pomp and spiritual pride. I would not
show thee the letter, I put it in the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Ian! I think then, that he has had many
things to suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rahal, this is what I will do. I will meet the
packet on Saturday and we will go first to my office
and talk the Hay letter over together. If I
bring Ian home with me, then something is possible,
but if I come home alone, then Thora must
understand that all is over&ndash;&ndash;that the young man
is not to be thought of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would kill her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it might be. But better is death than a living
misery. If Ian is what Jean Hay says he is,
could we think of our child living with him? Impossible!
Rahal, dear wife, whatever can be
done I will do, and that with wisdom and loving
kindness. Thy part is harder, it must be with our
dear Thora.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is so. And if there has to be parting,
it will be almost impossible to spread the plaster
as far as the sore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the Great Physician&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her what I have said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do that; but just yet, she is not minding
much what any one says.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, on Saturday afternoon Thora left
her bed and dressed herself in the gown she had
prepared for her bridegroom&#8217;s arrival. The nervous
shock had been severe and she looked woefully
like, and yet unlike, herself. Her eyes were
full of tears, she trembled, she could hardly support
herself. If one should take a fresh green
leaf and pass over it a hot iron, the change it made
might represent the change in Thora. Jean Hay&#8217;s
letter had been the hot iron passed over her. She
had been told of her father&#8217;s decision, but she
clung passionately to her faith in Ian and her claim
on her father&#8217;s love and mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father will do right,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and if he
does, Ian will come home with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The position was a cruel one to Conall Ragnor
and he went to meet the packet with a heavy
heart. Then Ian&#8217;s joyful face and his impatience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
to land made it more so, and Ragnor found it impossible
to connect wrong-doing with the open,
handsome countenance of the youth. On the contrary,
he found himself without intention declaring:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I never found anything the least
zig-zaggery about what he said or did. His words
and ways were all straight. That is the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet Ian&#8217;s happy mood was instantly dashed by
Ragnor&#8217;s manner. He did not take his offered
hand and he said in a formal tone: &#8220;Ian, we will
go to my office before we go to the house. I
must ask thee some questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir. Thora, I hope, is all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. She has been very ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me go to her, sir, at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Later, I will see about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Later is too late, let us go at once. If Thora
is sick&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be patient. It is not well to talk of women on
the street. No wise man, who loves his womenkin,
does that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ian was silent; and the walk through the
busy streets was like a walk in a bad dream. The
place and circumstances felt unreal and he was
conscious of the sure presence of a force closing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
about him, even to his finger tips. Vainly he tried
to think. He felt the trouble coming nearer and
nearer, but what was it? What had he done?
What had he failed to do? What was he to be
questioned about?</p>
<p>Young as he was his experiences had taught him
to expect only injury and wrong. The Ragnor
home and its love and truth had been the miracle
that had for nine months turned his brackish water
of life into wine. Was it going to fail him, as
everything else had done? He laughed inwardly
at the cruel thought and whispered to himself:
&#8220;This, too, can be borne, but oh, Thora, Thora!&#8221;
and the two words shattered his pride and made
him ready to weep when he sat down in Ragnor&#8217;s
office and saw the kind, pitiful face of the elder
man looking at him. It gave him the power he
needed and he asked bluntly what questions he
was required to answer.</p>
<p>Ragnor gave him the unhappy letter and he
read it with a look of anger and astonishment.
&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;all this woman writes is true
and not true; and of all accusations, these are the
worst to defend. I must go back to my very
earliest remembrances in order to fairly state my
case, and if you will permit me to do this, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
presence of your wife and Thora, I will then accept
whatever decision you make.&#8221;</p>
<p>For at least three minutes Ragnor made no answer.
He sat with closed eyes and his face held
in the clasp of his left hand. Ian was bending forward,
eagerly watching him. There was not a
movement, not a sound; it seemed as if both men
hardly breathed. But when Ragnor moved, he
stood up. &#8220;Let us be going,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they are
anxious. They are watching. You shall do as
you say, Ian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahal saw them first. Thora was lying back in
her mother&#8217;s chair with closed eyes. She could
not bear to look into the empty road watching for
one who might be gone forever. Then in a blessed
moment, Rahal whispered, &#8220;They are coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both? Both, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; And she would have cried out
her thanks and bathed them in joyful tears if
she had been alone. But Ian must not see her
weeping. Now, especially, he must be met with
smiles. And then, when she felt herself in Ian&#8217;s
embrace, they were both weeping. But oh, how
great, how blessed, how sacramental are those joys
that we baptise with tears!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>During the serving of dinner there was no conversation
but such as referred to the war and
other public events. Many great ones had transpired
since they parted, and there was plenty to
talk about: the battles of Balaklava and Inkerman
had been fought; the never-to-be-forgotten
splendour of Scarlett&#8217;s Charge with the Heavy
Brigade, and the still more tragically splendid one
of the Light Brigade, had both passed into history.</p>
<p>More splendid and permanent than these had
been the trumpet &#8220;call&#8221; of Russell in the <i>Times</i>,
asking the women of England who among them
were ready to go to Scutari Hospital and comfort
and help the men dying for England?
&#8220;Now,&#8221; he cried,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;The Son of God goes forth to war!<br />
Who follows in His train?&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Florence Nightingale and her band of trained
nurses, mainly from the Roman Catholic Sisters
of Mercy, and St. John&#8217;s Protestant House, was
the instant answer. In six days they were ready
and without any flourish of trumpets, at the dark,
quiet midnight, they left England for Scutari and
in that hour the Red Cross Society was born.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How long is it since they sailed?&#8221; asked Rahal.</p>
<p>&#8220;A month,&#8221; answered Ian, &#8220;but the controversy
about it is still raging in the English papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has anyone to say against it?&#8221; asked
Rahal. &#8220;The need was desperate, the answer
quick. What, then, do they say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The prudery of the English middle class was
shocked at the idea of young women nursing in
military hospitals. They considered it &#8216;highly
improper.&#8217; Others were sure women would be
more trouble than help. Many expect their health
to fail, and think they will be sent back to English
hospitals in a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Ragnor, &#8220;that the objections
were chiefly religious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; replied Ian. &#8220;The Calvinists
are afraid Miss Nightingale&#8217;s intention is to make
the men Catholics in their dying hour. Others
feel sure Miss Nightingale is an Universalist, or
an Unitarian, or a Wesleyan Methodist. The
fact is, Florence Nightingale is a devout Episcopalian.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pleasant little smile parted Ragnor&#8217;s lips, and
he said with an Episcopalian suavity: &#8220;The Wesleyans
and the Episcopalians, in doctrine, are much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
alike. We regard them as brethren;&#8221; and just
while he spoke, Ragnor looked like some ecclesiastical
prelate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is little to wonder at in the churches
disagreeing about Miss Nightingale,&#8221; said Rahal,
&#8220;it is not to be expected that they would believe
in her, when they do not believe in each other.&#8221;
As she spoke she stepped to the fireside and
touched the bell rope, and a servant entered and
began to clear the table and put more wood on
the fire, and to turn out one of the lamps at Rahal&#8217;s
order. Ragnor had gone out to have a quiet
smoke in the fresh air while Rahal was sending
off all the servants to a dance at the Fisherman&#8217;s
Hall. Ian and Thora were not interested in these
things; they sat close together, talking softly of
their own affairs.</p>
<p>Without special request, they drew closer to the
hearth and to each other. Then Ragnor took out
a letter and handed it to Ian. He was sitting at
Thora&#8217;s side and her hand was in his hand. He
let it fall and took the letter offered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot explain this letter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;unless
I preface it with some facts regarding my unhappy
childhood and youth. I am, as you know, the son
of Dr. Macrae, but I have been a disinherited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
son ever since I can remember. I suppose that in
my earliest years I was loved and kindly treated,
but I have no remembrance of that time. I know
only that before I was five years old, my father
had accepted the solemn conviction that I was
without election to God&#8217;s grace. Personally I was
a beautiful child, but I was received and considered,
body and soul, as unredeemable. Father
then regarded me as a Divine decree which it was
his duty to receive with a pious acquiescence. My
mother pitied and, in her way, loved me, and suffered
much with me. I have a little sister also,
who would like to love me, but there is in all her
efforts just that touch of Phariseeism which destroys
love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Ian, there must have been some reason
for your father&#8217;s remarkable conviction?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is most likely. If so, he never explained
the fact to me or even to my mother. She told me
once that he did not suspect that I had missed
God&#8217;s election until I was between five and six
years old. I suppose that about that age I began
to strengthen his cruel fear by my antipathy to the
kirk services and my real and unfortunate inability
to learn the Shorter Catechism. This was a natural
short-coming. I could neither spell or pronounce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the words I was told to learn and to memorise
them was an impossible thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could not your mother help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She tried. She wept over me as she tried, and
I made an almost superhuman effort to comprehend
and remember. I could not. I was flogged,
I was denied food and even water. I was put in
dark rooms. I was forbid all play and recreation.
I went through this martyrdom year after year
and I finally became stubborn and would try no
longer. In the years that followed, until I was
sixteen, my daily sufferings were great, but I remember
them mainly for my mother&#8217;s sake, who
suffered with me in all I suffered. Nor am I without
pity for my father. He honestly believed that
in punishing me he was doing all he could to save
me from everlasting punishment. Yes, sir! Do
not shake your head! I have heard him praying,
pleading with God, for some token of my election
to His mercy. You see it was John Calvin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John Calvin!&#8221; ejaculated Ragnor, &#8220;how is
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was his awful tenets I had to learn; and
when I was young I could not learn them, and
when I grew older I would not learn them. My
father had called me John Calvin and I detested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the name. On my eighteenth birthday I asked him
to have it changed. He was very angry at my
request. I begged him passionately to do so. I
said it ruined my life, that I could do nothing
under that name. &#8216;Give me your own name,
Father,&#8217; I entreated, &#8216;and I will try and be a good
man!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said something to me, I never knew exactly
what, but the last word was more than I
could bear and my reply was an oath. Then he
lifted the whip at his side and struck me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahal and Thora were sobbing. Ragnor looked
in the youth&#8217;s face with shining eyes and asked,
almost in a whisper, &#8220;What did thou do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had been struck often enough before to have
made me indifferent, but at this moment some new
strength and feeling sprang up in my heart. I
seized his arms and the whip fell to the floor. I
lifted it and said, &#8216;Sir, if you ever again use a
whip in place of decent words to me, I will see you
no more until we meet for the judgment of God.
Then I will pity you for the life-long mistake you
have made.&#8217; My father looked at me with eyes
I shall never forget, no, not in all eternity! He
burst into agonizing prayer and weeping and I
went and told mother to go to him. I left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
house there and then. I had not a halfpenny, and
I was hungry and cold and sick with an intolerable
sense of wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; said Thora, in a voice broken with
weeping. &#8220;Is not this enough?&#8221; And Ragnor
leaned forward and took Thora&#8217;s hand but he did
not speak. Neither did he answer Rahal&#8217;s look
of entreaty. On the contrary he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Ian? Then, what did thou do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt so ill I went to see Dr. Finlay, our family
physician. He knew the family trouble, because
he had often attended mother when she was
ill in consequence of it. I did not need to make
a complaint. He saw my condition and took me
to his wife and told her to feed and comfort me.
I remained in her care four days, and then he offered
to take me into his office and set me to reading
medical text books, while I did the office
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was this work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was taught how to prepare ordinary medicines,
to see callers when the doctor was out, and
make notes of, and on, their cases. I helped the
doctor in operations, I took the prescriptions to
patients and explained their use, etc. In three
years I became very useful and helpful and I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
quite happy. Then Dr. Finlay was appointed to
some exceptionally fine post in India, private
physician to some great Rajah, and the Finlay
family hastily prepared for their journey to Delhi.
I longed to go with them but I had not the money
requisite. With Dr. Finlay I had had a home
but only money enough to clothe me decently. I
had not a pound left and mother could not help
me, and Uncle Ian was in the Madeira Isles with
his sick wife. So the Finlays went without me;
and I can feel yet the sense of loneliness and poverty
that assailed me, when I shut their door behind
me and walked into the cold street and knew
not what to do or where to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How old were you then, Ian?&#8221; asked Ragnor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was twenty years old within a few days, and
I had one pound, sixteen shillings in my pocket.
Five pounds from an Episcopal church would be
due in two weeks for my solo and part singing in
their services; but they were never very prompt
in their payment and that was nothing to rely on
in my present need. I took to answering advertisements,
and did some of the weariest tramping
looking for work that poor humanity can do.
When I met Kenneth McLeod, I had broken my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
last shilling. I was like a hungry, lost child, and
the thought of my mother came to me and I felt
as if my heart would break.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next moment I saw Kenneth McLeod coming
up Prince&#8217;s Street. It was nearly four years
since we had seen each other, but he knew me at
once and called me in his old kind way. Then he
looked keenly at me, and asked: &#8216;What is the matter,
Ian? The old trouble?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so heartless and hungry I could hardly
keep back tears as I answered: &#8216;It is that and
everything else! Ken, help me, if you can.&#8217;
&#8216;Come with me!&#8217; he answered, and I went with
him into the Queen&#8217;s Hotel and he ordered dinner,
and while we were eating I told him my situation.
Then he said, &#8216;I can help you, Ian, if you
will help me. You know that all my happiness is
on the sea and father kept me on one or another
of his trading boats as much as possible from my
boyhood, so that I am now a clever enough navigator.
Two years ago my father died and I am
in a lot of trouble about managing the property he
left me. Now, if you will take the oversight of
my Edinburgh property, I can take my favourite
boat and look after the coast trade of the Northern
Islands.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What could I say? I was dumb with surprise
and gratitude. I never thought there was anything
wrong in our contract. I believed the work
had come in answer to my prayer for help and I
thanked God and Kenneth McLeod for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Ragnor rose, saying, &#8220;Coll, my dear
one, Thora and I will now leave thee. I am sure
Ian has done as well as he could do and we hope
thou wilt judge him kindly.&#8221; Then the women
went upstairs and Ragnor remained silent until
Ian said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very anxious, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ragnor stood up and slowly answered,
&#8220;Ian, now is the time to take council of my pillow.
What I have to say I will say later. This is not a
thing to be settled by a yes or no. I must think
over what thou hast told me. I must have some
words with my wife and daughter. Sleep one
night at least over thy trouble, there are many
things to consider; especially this question of the
young lady who is made the last count of Jean
Hay&#8217;s letter. What hast thou to say about her?
She seems to have had some strong claim upon
thy&ndash;&ndash;shall we say friendship?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might say much more than friendship,
sir, and yet wrong neither man nor woman by it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
Why, the young lady was Agnes Henderson, the
sister of Willie Henderson, who is my soul&#8217;s
brother and my second self. Thora must have
heard all about Agnes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she Deacon Scot Henderson&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she is! Who else would I have left
two engagements to serve? But Agnes is dear
to me, perhaps dearer than my own sister. Since
she was nine years old, we have studied and played
together. Willie and Agnes were the only loves
and only friends of my desolate boyhood. You
have doubtless heard how unhappy the deacon&#8217;s
second marriage has been. Both Willie and Agnes
refused the stepmother he gave them, and last
year Willie went to New York, where he is doing
very well. But Agnes has been more and more
wretched, and a recent proposal of marriage between
herself and the stepmother&#8217;s nephew has
made her life intolerable. Two weeks ago I had
a letter from Willie, telling me he had just written
her, advising an immediate &#8216;give-up&#8217; of the
whole situation. He told her to take the first
good steamer and come to him. He also urged
her to send for me and take my help and advice
about the voyage. Two weeks ago last Friday
she did so and I went at once to the West End
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Hotel to see her. She had disguised herself so
cleverly that it was difficult to recognise her. I
went with her to her sitting room and there I
found the woman who had waited on her all her
life long. I knew her well for she had often
scolded me for leading Agnes into danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ate lunch with Agnes and during it I told
her to transfer all her money not required for
travelling expenses to the Bank of New York;
and I promised to go at once and secure a passage
for herself and maid&ndash;&ndash;for seeing that the <i>Atlantic</i>
would leave her dock for New York about the
noon hour of the next day, haste was necessary.
I did not wish to go to Liverpool because of my
two engagements, but Agnes was so insistent on
my presence I could not refuse her. Well, perhaps
I was wrong to yield to her entreaties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, hardly,&#8221; said Ragnor. &#8220;Going on board
a big steamer at Liverpool must be a muddling
business&ndash;&ndash;not fit for two simple women like Agnes
Henderson and her maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember thinking of that but I could
hear my friend Willie telling me, &#8216;See her safe on
board, Ian. Don&#8217;t leave her till she is in the captain&#8217;s
care. Do this for me, Ian!&#8217; And I did it
for both Agnes&#8217; and Willie&#8217;s sake but mainly for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Willie&#8217;s, for I love him. He is my right-hand
friend, always. Perhaps I did wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pity there was any mystification about
it. Was it necessary for Agnes Henderson to disguise
herself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, but it prevented trouble and disappointment.
Her father supposed her to be at
her uncle&#8217;s home. On Saturday afternoon he went
to see her and found she had not been there at all.
He returned to Edinburgh and could get no trace
of her, nor was she located until I returned and
informed him that she was on the <i>Atlantic</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a few moments of silence and then
Ian said, &#8220;Have I done anything unpardonable?
Surely you will not let that jealous, envious letter
stand between Thora and myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ragnor answered, &#8220;Tonight I will say
neither this nor that on the matter. I will sleep
over the subject and take counsel of One wiser
than myself. Thou had better do likewise. Many
things are to consider.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ian went away without a word. There
was anger in his heart, and as he sat gloomily in
his dimly lit room and felt the damp chill of the
midnight, he told himself that he had been hardly
judged. &#8220;I have done nothing wrong,&#8221; he whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
passionately. &#8220;Old McLeod collected his
own rents and looked after his own property and
no one thought he did wrong. He was an elder
in one of the largest Edinburgh kirks and the favourite
chairman in missionary meetings, but because
I did not go to kirk, what was business in
him was sin in me.</p>
<p>&#8220;As to the gambling houses, I had nothing to
do with them but to collect lawful money, due the
McLeod estate; and as far as I can see, men who
gamble for money are quite respectable if they
get what they gamble for. There was that old
reprobate Lord Sinclair. He redeemed the Sinclair
estates by gambling and he married the beautiful
daughter of the noble Seaforths. Nobody
blamed him. Pshaw! It is all a matter of money&ndash;&ndash;or
it is my ill luck.&#8221; And to such irritating reflections
he finally fell asleep.</p>

<p>At her room door Thora bid her mother
good night. Rahal desired to talk with her,
but the girl shook her head and said wearily, &#8220;I
want to think, Mother. I have no heart to
speak yet.&#8221; And Rahal turned sadly away. She
knew that hour, that her child had come to a door
for which she had no key and she left her alone
with the situation she had to face. Nor did Thora
just then realize that within the past hour her
girlhood had vanished, and that she had suddenly
become a woman with a woman&#8217;s fate upon her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
and a woman&#8217;s heart-rending problem to solve.</p>
<p>How it came she did not enquire, yet she did
recognise some change in herself. Hitherto, all
her troubles had been borne by her father or
mother. This trouble was her very own. No one
could carry it for her but without any hesitation
she accepted it. &#8220;I must find out the very root
of this matter,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;and I will not
go to bed until I do. Nor is it half-asleep I will be
over the question. I will sit up and be wide
awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she put more peat and coal on her fire and
lit a fresh candle; removed her day clothing and
wrapped herself in a large down cloak. And the
night was not cold for there was a southerly wind,
and the gulf stream embraces the Orkneys, giving
them an abnormally warm climate for their far-north
latitude. And she had a passing wonder at
herself for these precautions. A year ago, a week
ago, she would have thrown herself upon her bed
in passionate weeping or clung to her mother and
talked her sorrow away in her loving sympathy
and advice.</p>
<p>But at this supreme hour of her life, she wanted
to be alone. She did not wish to talk about Ian
with any one. She was wide awake, quite sensible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
of the pain and grief at her heart, yet tearless and
calm. Never before had she felt that dignity of
soul, which looks straight into the face of its sorrow
and feels itself equal to the bearing of it.
She had as yet no idea that during that evening
she had passed through that wonderful heart-experience,
which suddenly ripens girlhood into
womanhood. Indeed, they will be thoughtless
girls&ndash;&ndash;whatever their age&ndash;&ndash;who can read this
sentence and not pause and recall that marvellous
transition in their own lives. To some it comes
with a great joy, to others with a great sorrow
but it is always a fateful event, and girls should
be ready to meet and salute it.</p>
<p>As soon as Thora had made herself and her
room comfortable, she sat down and closed her
eyes. All her life she had noticed that her mother
shut her eyes when she wanted to think. Now
she did the same, and then softly called Ian Macrae
to the judgment of her heart and her inner
senses, but she did it as naturally as women equally
ignorant have done it in all ages, taking or refusing
their advice or verdict as directed by their
dominant desire, or their reason or unreason.</p>
<p>With almost supernatural clearness she recalled
his beautiful, yet troubled face, his hesitating manner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
his restlessness in his chair, his nervous trifling
with his watch chain or his finger ring. She recalled
the fact that his voice had in it a strange
tone and that his eyes reflected a soul fearful and
angry. It was an unfamiliar Ian she called up,
but oh! if it could ever become a familiar one.</p>
<p>The first subject that pressed her for consideration
was the suspicion of gambling. Certainly
Ian had promptly denied the charge. He had
even said that he never was in the gambling parlours
but once, when he went into them very early
with the porter, to assure himself that some new
carpets asked for were really wanted. &#8220;Then,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;I found out that the demand was made
by one of the club members, who had a friend who
was a carpet manufacturer and expected to supply
what was considered necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be recalled here that Norsemen, though
sharp and keen in business matters, have no gambling
fever in their blood. To get money and give
nothing for it! That goes too far beyond their
idea of fair business, and as for pleasure, they
have never connected it with the paper kings and
queens. They find in the sea and their ships, in
adventure, in music and song, in dancing and story
telling, all of pleasure they require. A common
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
name for a pack of cards is &#8220;the devil&#8217;s books,&#8221;
and in Orkney they have but few readers.</p>
<p>Thora had partially exonerated Ian from the
charge of gambling when she remembered Jean
Hay&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;wherever horses were racing,
there Ian was sure to be and that he had been
named in the newspapers as a winner on the horse
Sergius.&#8221; Ian had passed by this circumstance,
and her father had either intentionally or unintentionally
done the same. Once she had heard
Vedder say that &#8220;horse racing produced finer and
faster horses&#8221;; and she remembered well, that her
father asked in reply, &#8220;If it was well to produce
finer and faster horses, at the cost of making
horsier men?&#8221; And he had further said that he
did not know of any uglier type of man than a
&#8220;betting book in breeches.&#8221; She thought a little
on this subject and then decided Ian ought to be
talked to about it.</p>
<p>Her lover&#8217;s neglect of the Sabbath was the next
question, for Thora was a true and loving daughter
of the Church of England. Episcopacy was
the kernel of her faith. She believed all bishops
were just like Bishop Hedley and that the most
perfect happiness was found in the Episcopal
Communion. And she said positively to her heart&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
is through the church door we will reach
the Home door, and I am sure Ian will go with
me to keep the Sabbath in the cathedral. Every
one goes to church in Kirkwall. He could not resist
such a powerful public example, and then he
would begin to like to go of his own inclination.
I could trust him on this point, I feel sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she took up the next doubt her brow
clouded and a shadow of annoyance blended itself
with her anxious, questioning expression. &#8220;His
name!&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;His name! Why did he
woo me under a false name? Mother says my
marriage to him under the name of Ian Macrae
would not be lawful. Of course he intended to
marry me with his proper name. He would have
been sure to tell us all before the marriage day&ndash;&ndash;but
I saw father was angry and troubled at the
circumstance. He ought to have told us long
ago. Why didn&#8217;t he do so? I should have loved
him under any name. I should have loved him
better under John than Ian. John is a strong,
straight name. Great and good men in all ages
have made John honourable. It has no diminutive.
It can&#8217;t be made less than John. Englishmen
and lowland Scotch all say the four sensible
letters with a firm, strong voice; only the Celt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
turns John into Ian. I will not call him Ian again.
Not once will I do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she covered her eyes with her hand and a
sharp, chagrined catch of her breath broke the
hush of the still room. And her voice, though little
stronger than a whisper, was full of painful
wonder. &#8220;What will people say? What shall we
say? Oh, the shame! Oh, the mortification!
Who will now live in my pretty home? Who will
eat my wedding cake? What will become of my
wedding dress? Oh, Thora! Thora! Love has
led thee a shameful, cruel road! What wilt thou
do? What can thou do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a singular thing happened. A powerful
thought from some forgotten life came with irresistible
strength into her mind, and though she
did not speak the words suggested, she prayed
them&ndash;&ndash;if prayer be that hidden, never-dying imploration
that goes with the soul from one incarnation
to another&ndash;&ndash;for the words that sprang to
her memory must have been learned centuries before,
&#8220;Oh, Mary! Mary! Mother of Jesus
Christ! Thou that drank the cup of all a woman&#8217;s
griefs and wrongs, pray for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she was still and silent as the words passed
through her consciousness. She thought every one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
of them, they seemed at the moment so real and
satisfying. Then she began to wonder and ask
herself, &#8220;Where did those words come from?
When did I hear them? Where did I say them
before? How do they come to be in my memory?
From what strange depth of Life did they come?
Did I ever have a Roman Catholic nurse? Did
she whisper them to my soul, when I was sick
and suffering? I must ask mother&ndash;&ndash;oh, how tired
and sleepy I feel&ndash;&ndash;I will go to bed&ndash;&ndash;I have done
no good, come to no decision. I will sleep&ndash;&ndash;I will
tell mother in the morning&ndash;&ndash;I wish I had let her
stop with me&ndash;&ndash;mother always knows&ndash;&ndash;what is the
best way&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; And thus the heart-breaking session
ended in that blessed hostel, The Inn of
Dreamless Sleep.</p>
<p>There was, however, little sleep in the House
of Ragnor that night, and very early in the morning
Ragnor, fully dressed, spoke to his wife. &#8220;Art
thou waking yet, Rahal?&#8221; he asked, and Rahal
answered, &#8220;I have slept little. I have been long
awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, what dost thou think now of Ian
Macrae, so-called?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think little amiss of him&ndash;&ndash;some youthful follies&ndash;&ndash;nothing
to make a fuss about.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hast thou considered that the follies of youth
may become the follies of manhood, and of age?
What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not told to worry about what may
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ian has evidently been living and spending with
people far above his means and his class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lowland Scotch regard a minister as socially
equal to any peer. Are not the servants of
God equal, and more than equal, to the servants
of the queen? No society is above either they
or their children. That I have seen always. And
young men of fine appearance and charming manners,
like Ian, are welcome in every home, high
or low. Yes, indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet girls, as a rule, should not marry handsome
men with charming manners, unless there is
something better behind to rely on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If thou had not been a handsome man with a
charming manner, Rahal would not have married
thee. What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have been a ruined man. I cared for
nothing but thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that a girl of moral strength and
good intelligence should be trusted with the choice
of her destiny. It is not always that parents have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
a right to thrust a destiny they choose upon their
daughter. If a man is not as good and as rich
as they think she ought to marry they can point
this out, and if they convince their child, very
well; and if they do not convince her, also very
well. Perhaps the girl&#8217;s character requires just the
treatment it will evolve from a life of struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art talking nonsense, Rahal. Thy liking
for the young man has got the better of thy
good sense. I cannot trust thee in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Coll, the road to better counsel
than mine, is well known to thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Bishop Hedley arrived about an hour
ago. There were moving lights on the pier, and
as soon as the morning breaks I am going to see
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have thy own way. When a man&#8217;s wife has
not the wisdom wanted, it is well that he go to his
Bishop, for Bishops are full of good counsel, even
for the ruling of seven churches, so I have
heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not hearsay between thee and Bishop Hedley.
Thou art well acquainted with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, in the end thou wilt take thy own
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou want me to say &#8216;yes&#8217; today, and rue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
it tomorrow? I have no mind for any such foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coll, this is a time when deeds will be better
than words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that. Well then, the day breaks, and I
will go&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he lingered a minute or two fumbling
about his knitted gloves but Rahal was dressing
her hair and took no further notice. So he went
away in an affected hurry and both dissatisfied and
uncertain. &#8220;What a woman she is!&#8221; he sighed.
&#8220;She has said only good words, but I feel as if I
had broken every commandment at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went away full of trouble and anxiety, and
Rahal watched him down the garden path and
along the first stretch of the road. She knew by
his hurried steps and the nervous play of his
walking stick that he was both angry and troubled
and she was not very sorry.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it was his business standing and his good
name, instead of Thora&#8217;s happiness and good repute
that was the question, oh, how careful and
conciliatory he would be! How anxious to keep
his affairs from public discussion! It would be
anything rather than that! I have the same feeling
about Thora&#8217;s good name. The marriage
ought to go on for Thora&#8217;s sake. I do not want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
the women of Kirkwall wondering who was to
blame. I do not want them coming to see me with
solemn looks and tearful voices. I could not endure
their pitying of &#8216;poor Miss Thora!&#8217; They
would not dare go to Coll with their sympathetic
curiosity, but there are such women as Astar
Gager, and Lala Snackoll, and Thyra Peterson,
and Jorunna Flett. No one can keep them away
from a house in trouble. Thora must marry. I
see no endurable way to prevent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then being dressed she went to Thora&#8217;s room,
and gently opened the door. Thora was standing
at her mirror and she turned to her mother
with a smiling face. Rahal was astonished and
she said almost with a tone of disapproval, &#8220;I am
glad to see thee able to smile. I expected to find
thee weeping, and ill with weeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a long time, for many hours, I was broken-hearted
but there came to me, Mother, a strange
consolation.&#8221; Then she told her mother about
the prayer she heard her soul say for her. &#8220;Not
one word did I speak, Mother. But someone
prayed for me. I heard them. And I was made
strong and satisfied, and fell into a sweet sleep,
though I had yet not solved the problem I had
proposed to solve before I slept.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What was that problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First, whether I should marry John just as
he was, and trust the consequences to my influence
over him; or whether I should refuse him altogether
and forever; or whether I should wait and
see what he can do with my father and the good
Bishop, to help and strengthen him.&#8221; And as
Thora talked, Rahal&#8217;s face grew light and sweet
as she listened, and she answered&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Yes, my dear
one, that is the wonderful way! Some soul that
loved thee long, long ago, knew that thou wert in
great trouble. Some woman&#8217;s soul, perhaps, that
had lived and died for love. The kinship of our
souls far exceeds that of our bodies, and their
help is swift and sure. Be patient with Ian. That
is what I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why that prayer? I never heard it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How little thou knowest of what thou hast
heard before! Two hundred years ago, all sorrowful,
unhappy women went to Mary with their
troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They should not have done so. They could
have gone to Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They thought Mary had suffered just what
they were suffering, and they thought that Christ
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
had never known any of the griefs that break a
woman&#8217;s heart. Mary knew them, had felt them,
had wept and prayed over them. When my little
lad Eric died, I thought of Mary. My family
have only been one hundred years Protestants.
All of them must have loved thee well enough to
come and pray for thee. Thou had a great honour,
as well as a great comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate I did no wrong! I am glad,
Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong! Thou wilt see the Bishop today.
Ask him. He will tell thee that the English
Church and the English women gave up very reluctantly
their homage to Mary. Are not their
grand churches called after Peter and Paul and
other male saints? Dost thou think that Christ
loved Peter and Paul more than his mother? I
know better. Please God thou wilt know better
some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Churches are often called after Mary, as well
as the saints.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in Scotland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one in Glasgow. Vedder told me he
used to hear Bishop Hedley preach there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an Episcopal Church. Ask him about
thy dream. No, I mean thy soul&#8217;s experience.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thou said <i>dream</i>, Mother. It was not a
dream. I saw no one. I only heard a voice. It
is what we see in dreams that is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now wilt thou come to thy breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is <i>he</i> downstairs yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go and call him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahal, however, came to the table alone. She
said, &#8220;Ian asked that he might lie still and sleep
an hour or two. He has not slept all night long,
I think,&#8221; she added. &#8220;His voice sounded full of
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the two women ate their breakfast alone for
Ragnor did not return in time to join them. And
Rahal&#8217;s hopefulness left her, and she was silent
and her face had a grey, fearful expression that
Thora could not help noticing. &#8220;You look ill,
Mother!&#8221; she said, &#8220;and you were looking so
well when we came downstairs. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not. I feel as if I was going into a
black cloud. I wish that thy father would come
home. He is in trouble. I wonder then what is
the matter!&#8221;</p>
<p>In about an hour they saw Ragnor and the
Bishop coming towards the house together.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are in trouble, Thora, both of them are
in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&#8220;About Thora they need not to be in trouble.
She will do what they advise her to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not name my fear, lest I call it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she rose and went to the door and Thora
followed her, and by this time, Ragnor and the
Bishop were at the garden gate. Very soon the
Bishop was holding their hands, and Rahal found
when he released her hand that he had left a letter
in it. Yet for a moment she hardly noticed the
fact, so shocked was she at the expression of her
husband&#8217;s face. He looked so much older, his
eyes were two wells of sorrow, his distress had
passed beyond words, and when she asked, &#8220;What
is thy trouble, Coll?&#8221; he looked at her pitifully
and pointed to the letter. Then she took Thora&#8217;s
hand and they went to her room together.</p>
<p>Sitting on the side of her bed, she broke the
seal and looked at the superscription. &#8220;It is from
Adam Vedder,&#8221; she said, as she began to read it.
No other word escaped her lips until she came to
the end of the long epistle. Then she laid it down
on the bed beside her and shivered out the words,
&#8220;Boris is dying. Perhaps dead. Oh, Boris! My
son Boris! Read for thyself.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>So Thora read the letter. It contained a vivid
description of the taking of a certain small battery,
which was pouring death and destruction on
the little British company, who had gone as a forlorn
hope to silence its fire. They were picked
volunteers and they were led by Boris Ragnor.
He had made a breach in its defences and carried
his men over the cannon to victory. At the last
moment he was shot in the throat and received a
deadly wound in the side, as he tore from the hands
of the Ensign the flag of his regiment, wrote Vedder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw the fight between the men. I was carrying
water to the wounded on the hillside. I, and several
others, rushed to the side of Boris. He held the flag
so tightly that no hand could remove it, and we carried
it with him to the hospital. For two days he remained
there, then he was carefully removed to my house,
not very far away, and now he has not only one of
Miss Nightingale&#8217;s nurses always with him but also
myself. As for Sunna, she hardly ever leaves him.
He talks constantly of thee and his father and sister.
He sends all his undying love, and if indeed these
wounds mean his death, he is dying gloriously and
happily, trusting God implicitly, and loving even his
enemies&ndash;&ndash;a thing Adam Vedder cannot understand.
He found out before he was twenty years old that
loving his enemies was beyond his power and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
nothing could make him forgive them. Our dear
Boris! Oh, Rahal! Rahal! Poor stricken mother!
God comfort thee, and tell thyself every minute &#8220;My
boy has won a glorious death and he is going the way
of all flesh, honoured and loved by all who ever knew
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This letter upset all other considerations, and
when Ian came downstairs at the dinner hour, he
found no one interested enough in his case to take
it up with the proper sense of its importance.
Ragnor was steeped in silent grief. Rahal had
shut up her sorrow behind dry eyes and a closed
mouth. The Bishop had taken the seat next to
Thora. He felt as if no one had missed or even
thought of him. And such conversation as there
was related entirely to the war. Thora smiled at
him across the table, but he was not pleased at
Thora being able to smile; and he only returned
the courtesy with a doleful shake of the head.</p>
<p>After dinner Ian said something about going
to see McLeod, and then the Bishop interfered&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;No,
Ian,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I want you to walk as
far as the cathedral with me. Will you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure, sir.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then let us be going, while there is yet a little
sunshine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cathedral doors stood open, but there was
no one present except a very old woman, who at
their approach rose from her knees and painfully
walked away. The Bishop altered his course, so
as to greet her&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Good afternoon, Sister Odd!
Art thou suffering yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the pain that comes with many years, sir.
God makes it easy for me. Wilt thou bless me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast God&#8217;s blessing. Who can add to
it? God be with thee to the very end!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough is that. Thy hand a moment, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment they, stood silently hand clasped,
then parted, and the Bishop walked straight to
the vestry and taking a key from his pocket,
opened the door. There was a fire laid ready for
the match and he stooped and lit it, and Ian placed
his chair near by.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bring your own
chair near to me, Ian, I have something to say to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of that, Bishop. No one seemed
to care for my sorrow. I was made to feel this
day the difference between a son and a son-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There is a difference, a natural one, but you
have been treated as a son always. Ragnor has
told me all about those charges. You may speak
freely to me. It is better that you should do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I explained the charges to the whole family.
Do they not believe me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The explanation was only partial and one-sided.
I think the charge of gambling may be put
aside, with your promise to abstain from the appearance
of evil for the future. I understand your
position about the Sabbath. You should have gone
on singing in some church. Supposing you got no
spiritual help from it, you were at least lifting the
souls of others on the wings of holy song, and
you need not have mocked at the devout feelings
of others by music unfit for the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a bit of boyish folly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was something far more than that. I had
a letter from Jean Hay more than two months
ago and I investigated every charge she made
against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bishop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that, examined separately, they do not
indicate any settled sinfulness; but taken together
they indicate a variable temper, a perfectly untrained
nature, and a weak, unresisting will. Now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
Ian, a weak, good man is a dangerous type of a
bad man. They readily become the tools of
wicked men of powerful intellect and determined
character. I have met with many such cases.
Your change of name&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sir, I could not endure Calvin tacked on
to me! If you knew what I have suffered!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it all. Why did you not tell the Ragnors
on your first acquaintance with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ragnor liked Ian because it is the Highland
form for John, and Thora loved the name
and I did not like, while they knew so little of
me, to tell them I had only assumed it. I watched
for a good opportunity to speak concerning it and
none came. Then I thought I would consult you
at this time, before the wedding day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not have married you under the name
of Ian. Discard it at once. Take it as a pet name
between Thora and yourself, if you choose. No
doubt you thought Ian was prettier and more romantic
and suitable for your really handsome person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bishop, do not humiliate me! I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt I am correct. I have known
young men wreck their lives for some equally foolish
idea.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I will cast it off today. I will tell Thora the
truth tonight. Before we are married, I will advertise
it in next week&#8217;s <i>News</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you are married, I trust you will have
made the name of John Macrae so famous that
you will need no such advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Bishop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to go to the trenches at Redan or
to fight your way into Sebastopol. You have been
left too much to your own direction and your own
way. Obedience is the first round of the ladder
of Success. You must learn it. You can only
be a subordinate till you manage this lesson. Your
ideas of life are crude and provincial. You need
to see men making their way upward, in some
other places than in shops and offices. Above all,
you must learn to conquer yourself and your indiscreet
will. You are not a man, until you are
master in your own house and fear no mutiny
against your Will to act nobly. You have had
no opportunities for such education. Now take
one year to begin it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that I must put off my marriage
for a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Under present circumstances&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sir, that is not thinkable! It would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
too mortifying! I could not go back to Edinburgh.
I could not put off my marriage!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be obliged to do so. Do you imagine
the Ragnors will hold wedding festivities, while
their eldest son is dying, or his broken body on
its way home for burial?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought the ceremony would be entirely religious
and the festivities could be abandoned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what you wish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Bishop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will not get it. A year&#8217;s strict
mourning is due the dead, and the Ragnors will
give every hour of it. Boris is their eldest
son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They should remember also their living daughter
Thora will suffer as well as myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not putting yourself in a good light,
John Macrae. Thora loves her brother with a
great affection. Do you think she can comfort
her grief for his loss, by giving you any loving
honour that belongs to him? You do not know
Thora Ragnor. She has her mother&#8217;s just, strong
character below all her gentle ways, and what her
father and mother say she will endorse, without
question or reluctance. Now I know that Ragnor
had resolved on a year&#8217;s separation and discipline,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
before he heard of his son&#8217;s dangerous condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris was not dead when that Vedder letter
was written. He may not be dead now. He may
not be going to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only his wonderful physical strength that
has kept him alive so long. Vedder said to me,
they looked for his death at any hour. He cannot
recover. His wound is a fatal one. It is
beyond hope. Vedder wrote while he was yet
alive, so that he might perhaps break the blow to
his family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then do you advise me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ragnor intends to go back with you and myself
to Edinburgh. He will see your father and
offer to buy you a commission as ensign in a good
infantry regiment. We will ask your father if he
will join in the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father will not join in anything to help
me. How much will an ensign&#8217;s commission
cost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think four or five hundred pounds. Ragnor
would pay half, if your father would pay half.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ian rose to his feet, and his eyes blazed
with a fire no one had ever seen there before.
&#8220;Bishop,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I thank you for all you propose,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
but if I go to the trenches at Redan or the
camp at Sebastopol, I will go on John Macrae&#8217;s
authority and personality. I have one hundred
pounds, that is sufficient. I can learn all the great
things you expect me to learn there better among
the rankers than the officers. I have known the
officers at Edinburgh Castle. They were not fit
candidates for a bishopric.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good man looked sadly at the angry youth
and answered, &#8220;Go and talk the matter over with
Thora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will. Surely she will be less cruel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you wish, considering present circumstances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the marriage carried out, devoid of all
but its religious ceremony. I want to spend one
month in the home prepared for us, and then I
will submit to the punishment and schooling proposed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you will not. Do not throw away this
opportunity to retrieve your so far neglected, misguided
life. There is a great man in you, if you
will give him space and opportunity to develop,
John. This is the wide open door of Opportunity;
go through, and go up to where it will lead
you. At any rate do whatever Thora advises. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
can trust you as far as Thora can.&#8221; Then he held
out his hand, and Ian, too deeply moved to speak,
took it and left the cathedral without a word.</p>
<p>He found Thora alone in the parlour. She had
evidently been weeping but that fact did not much
soothe his sense of wrong and injustice. He felt
that he had been put aside in some measure. He
was not sure that even now Thora had been weeping
for his loss. He told himself, she was just as
likely to have been mourning for Boris. He felt
that he was unjustly angry but, oh, he was so
hopeless! Every one was ready to give him advice,
no one had said to him those little words of
loving sympathy for which his heart was hungry.
He had felt it to be his duty to try and console
Thora, and Thora had wept in his arms and he
had kissed her tears away. She was now weary
with weeping and suffering with headache. She
knew also that talking against any decision of
her father&#8217;s was useless. When he had said the
word, the man or woman that could move him did
not live. Acceptance of the will of others was
a duty she had learned to observe all her life, it
was just the duty that Ian had thought it right to
resist. So amid all his love and disappointment,
there was a cruel sense of being of secondary interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
and importance, just at the very time he had
expected to be first in everyone&#8217;s love and consideration.</p>
<p>Finally he said, &#8220;Dear Thora, I can feel no
longer. My heart has become hopeless. I suffer
too much. I will go to my room and try and
submit to this last cruel wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Thora was offended. &#8220;There is no one
to blame for this last cruel wrong but thyself,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;The death of Boris was a nearer
thing to my father and mother than my marriage.
Thy marriage can take place at some other time,
but for my dear brother there is no future in
this life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you even sure of his death?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother has seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To you, I dare say it is. Mother sees more
than any one else can see. She has spiritual vision.
We are not yet able for it, nor worthy of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did she not see our wedding catastrophe?
She might have averted it by changing
the date.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask her;&#8221; and as Thora said these words and
wearily closed her eyes, Rahal entered the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
She went straight to Ian, put her arms round him
and kissed him tenderly. Then Ian could bear no
more. He sobbed like a boy of seven years old
and she wept with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou poor unloved laddie!&#8221; she said. &#8220;If
thou had gone wrong, it would have been little
wonder and little blame to thyself. I think thou
did all that could be done, with neither love nor
wisdom to help thee. Rahal does not blame thee.
Rahal pities and loves thee. Thou hast been
cowed and frightened and punished for nothing,
all the days of thy sad life. Poor lad! Poor, disappointed
laddie! With all my heart and soul I
pity thee!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments there was not a word
spoken and the sound of Ian&#8217;s bitter weeping filled
the room. Ian had been flogged many a time when
but a youth, and had then disdained to utter a
cry, but no child in its first great sorrow, ever
wept so heart-brokenly as Ian now wept in Rahal&#8217;s
arms. And a man weeping is a fearsome, pitiful
sound. It goes to a woman&#8217;s heart like a sword,
and Thora rose and went to her lover and drew
him to the sofa and sat down at his side and, with
promises wet with tears, tried to comfort him. A
strange silence that the weeping did not disturb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
was in the house and room, and in the kitchen the
servants paused in their work and looked at each
other with faces full of pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Wise One has put trouble on their heads,&#8221;
said a woman who was dressing a goose to roast
for dinner and her helper answered, &#8220;And there
is no use striving against it. What must be, is
sure to happen. That is Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All that we have done, is no good. Fate rules
in this thing. I see that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble came on them unawares. And
if Death is at the beginning, no course that can
be taken is any good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the Master&#8217;s will? For in the end,
that will orders all things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mistress said the marriage would be put
off for a year. The young man goes to the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder then he cries out. It is surely
a great disappointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Snackoll had the same ill luck. He made
no crying about it. He hoisted sail at midnight
and stole his wife Vestein out of her window,
and when her father caught them, they were man
and wife. And Snackoll went out to speak to his
father-in-law and he said to him, &#8216;My wife can not
see thee today, for she is weary and I think it best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
for her to be still and quiet&#8217;; and home the father
went and no good of his journey. Snackoll got
praise for his daring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; said a young man who had just
entered, &#8220;it is well known that Vestein and her
father and mother were all fully willing. The girl
could as easily have gone out of the door as the
window. Snackoll is a boaster. He is as great in
his talk as a fox in his tail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the household of Ragnor talked in the
kitchen, and in the parlour Rahal comforted the
lovers, and cheered and encouraged Ian so greatly
that she was finally able to say to them:</p>
<p>&#8220;The wedding day was not lucky. Let it pass.
There is another, only a year away, that will bring
lasting joy. Now we have wept over our mischance,
we will bury it and look to the future.
We will go and wash away sorrow and put on
fresh clothes, and look forward to the far better
marriage a year hence.&#8221;</p>
<p>And her voice and manner were so persuasive,
that they willingly obeyed her advice and, as they
passed her, she kissed them both and told Ian to
put his head in cold water and get rid of its aching
fever, for she said, &#8220;The Bishop will want thee
to sing some of thy Collects and Hymns and thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
wilt like to please him. He is thy good friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is. Thou may take that, on my word.&#8221;</p>
<p>The evening brought a braver spirit. They
talked of Boris and of his open-hearted, open-air
life, and the Bishop read aloud several letters from
young men then at the front. They were full of
enthusiasm. They might have been read to an
accompaniment of fife and drums. Ian was visibly
affected and made no further demur about joining
them. One of them spoke of Boris &#8220;leading
his volunteers up the hill like a lion&#8221;; and another
letter described his tenderness to the wounded and
convalescents, saying &#8220;he spent his money freely,
to procure them little comforts they could not get
for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked plainly and from their hearts, hesitating
not to call his name, and so they brought
comfort to their heavy sorrow. For it is a selfish
thing to shut up a sorrow in the heart, far
better to look at it full in the face, speak of it, discuss
its why and wherefore and break up that false
sanctity which is very often inspired by purely
selfish sentiments. And when this point was
reached, the Bishop took from his pocket a small
copy of the Apocrypha and said, &#8220;Now I will tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
you what the wisest of men said of such an early
death as that of our dear Boris:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He pleased God, and he was beloved of him, so
that living among sinners, he was translated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness
should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile
his soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled
a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;For his soul pleased the Lord, therefore hasted he
to take him away from among the wicked.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And these words fell like heavenly dew on every
heart. There was no comfort and honour greater
than this to offer even a mother&#8217;s heart. A happy
sigh greeted the blessed verses, and there was no
occasion to speak. There was no word that could
be added to it.</p>
<p>Then Ian had a happy thought for before a
spell-breaking word could be said, he stepped
softly to the piano and the next moment the room
was ringing with some noble lines from the &#8220;Men
of Harlech&#8221; set to notes equally stirring:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Men of Harlech, young or hoary,<br />
Would you win a name in story,<br />
Strike for home, for life, for glory,<br />
Freedom, God and Right!<br />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span><br />
&#8220;Onward! &#8217;Tis our country needs us,<br />
He is bravest, he who leads us,<br />
Honour&#8217;s self now proudly leads us,<br />
Freedom! God and Right!<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>Loose the folds asunder!<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>Flag we conquer under!<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>Death is glory now.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The words were splendidly sung and the room
was filled with patriotic fervour. Then the
Bishop gave Ragnor and Thora a comforting
look, as he asked, &#8220;Who wrote that song, Ian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sir, it was never written! It sprang from
the heart of some old Druid priest as he was urging
on the Welsh to drive the Romans from their
country. It is two verses from &#8216;The Song of the
Men of Harlech.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In olden times, Ian, the bards went to the battlefield
with the soldiers. We ought to send our
singers to the trenches. Ian, go and sing to the
men of England and of France &#8216;The Song of the
Men of Harlech.&#8217; Your song will be stronger
than your sword.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will sing it to my sword, sir. It will make it
sharper.&#8221; Then Rahal said, &#8220;You are a brave
boy, Ian,&#8221; and Thora lifted her lovely face and
kissed him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>Every heart was uplifted, and the atmosphere
of the room was sensitive with that exalted feeling
which finds no relief in speech. Humanity
soon reacts against such tension. There was a
slight movement, every one breathed heavily, like
people awakening from sleep, and the Bishop said
in a slow, soft voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of Boris. After all, the dear
lad may return to us. Surgeons are very clever
now, they can almost work miracles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boris will not return,&#8221; said Rahal.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you know that, Rahal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the afternoon of the eleventh of this
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bishop, I was making the cap I am
wearing and I was selecting from some white roses
on my lap the ones I thought best. Suddenly Boris
stood at my side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Bishop. I saw him plainly, though I do
not remember lifting my head.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How did he look?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like one who had just won a victory. He was
much taller and grander in appearance. Oh, he
looked like one who had realized God&#8217;s promise
that we should be satisfied. A kind of radiance
was around him and the air of a conquering soldier.
And he was my boy still! He called me
&#8216;Mother,&#8217; he sent such a wonderful message to
his father.&#8221; And at the last word, Ragnor uttered
just such a sharp, short gasp as might have
come from the rift of a broken heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ask him any question, Rahal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not speak, but my soul longed to know
what he was doing and the longing was immediately
answered. &#8216;I am doing the will of the Lord
of Hosts,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I was needed here.&#8217; Then
I felt his kiss on my cheek, and I lifted my head
and looked at the clock. It had struck three just
as I was conscious of the presence of Boris. It
was only two minutes past three, but I seemed to
have lived hours in that two minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think, Bishop, that God loves a soldier?
He may employ them and yet not love
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Bishop straightened himself and
lifted his head, and his face glowed and his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
shone as he answered, &#8220;I will give you one example,
it could be multiplied indefinitely. Paul
of Tarsus, a pale, beardless young man, dressed
as a Roman soldier, is bringing prisoners to Damascus.
Christ meets him on the road and Paul
knows instantly that he has met the Captain of his
soul. Hence forward, he is beloved and honoured
and employed for Christ, and at the end of life
he is joyful because he has fought a good
fight and knows that his reward is waiting
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;God has given us the names of many soldiers
beloved of Him&ndash;&ndash;Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Gideon,
David, etc. What care he took of them!
What a friend in all extremities he was to them!
All men who fight for their Faith, Home and
Country, for Freedom, Justice and Liberty, are
God&#8217;s armed servants. They do His will on the
battlefield, as priests do it at the altar. So then,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;In the world&#8217;s broad field of battle,<br />

<p>&#8220;We were speaking of the bards going to the
battlefield with the soldiers, and as I was quoting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
that verse of Longfellow&#8217;s a few lines from the
old bard we call Ossian came into my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us, then,&#8221; said Thora, &#8220;wilt thou not say
the words to us, our dear Bishop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do that gladly:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Father of Heroes, high dweller of eddying winds,<br />
Where the dark, red thunder marks the troubled cloud,<br />
Open Thou thy stormy hall!<br />
Let the bards of old be near.<br />
Father of heroes! the people bend before thee.<br />
Thou turnest the battle in the field of the brave,<br />
Thy terrors pour the blasts of death,<br />
Thy tempests are before thy face,<br />
But thy dwelling is calm above the clouds,<br />
The fields of thy rest are pleasant.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;When I was a young man,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I
used to read Ossian a good deal. I liked its vast,
shadowy images, its visionary incompleteness, just
because we have not yet invented the precise words
to describe the indescribable.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they talked, until the frugal Orcadian supper
of oatmeal and milk, and bread and cheese, appeared.
Then the night closed and sealed what
the day had done, and there was no more speculation
about Ian&#8217;s future. The idea of a military
life as a school for the youth had sprung up strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
and rapidly, and he was now waiting, almost impatiently,
for it to be translated into action.</p>
<p>A few restful, pleasant days followed. Ragnor
was preparing to leave his business for a week, the
Bishop was settling some parish difficulties, and
Ian and Thora were permitted to spend their time
as they desired. They paid one farewell visit to
their future home and found an old woman who
had nursed Thora in charge of the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt find everything just so, when you
two come home together, my baby,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Not a pin will be out of its place, not a speck of
dust on anything. Eva will always be ready, and
please God you may call her far sooner than you
think for.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sabbath, the last Sabbath of the old year,
was to be their last day together, and the Bishop
desired Ian to make it memorable with song. Ian
was delighted to do so and together they chose
for his two solos, &#8220;O for the Wings of a Dove,&#8221;
and the heavenly octaves of &#8220;He Hath Ascended
Up on High and Led Captivity Captive.&#8221; The
old cathedral&#8217;s great spaces were crowded, the
Bishop was grandly in the spirit, and he easily led
his people to that solemn line where life verges
on death and death touches Immortality. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Christ the beginning, and the end; Christ the victim
on the cross, and Christ the God of the Ascension!
And he sent every one home with the
promise of Immortality in their souls and the light
of it on their faces. His theme had touched
largely on the Christ of the Resurrection, and the
mystery and beauty of this Christ was made familiar
to them in a way they had not before considered.</p>
<p>Ragnor was afraid it had perhaps been brought
too close to their own conception of a soul, who
was seen on earth after the death of the body.
&#8220;You told the events of Christ&#8217;s forty days on
earth after His crucifixion so simply, Bishop,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and yet with much of the air that our
people tell a ghost story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, dear Conall, I was telling them
the most sacred ghost story of the world, and yet
it is the most literal reality in history. If it were
only a dream, it would be the most dynamic event
in human destiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Bishop, there is so much in your way
of preaching. It has that kind of good comradeship
which I think was so remarkable in Christ.
His style was not the ten commandments&#8217; style&ndash;&ndash;thou
shalt and thou shalt not&ndash;&ndash;but that reasoning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
brotherly way of &#8216;What man is there among you
that would not do the kind and right thing?&#8217; You
used it this very morning when you cried out, &#8216;If
our dear England needed your help to save her
Liberty and Life, what man is there among you
that would not rise up like lions to save her?&#8217;
And the men could hardly sit still. It was so real,
so brotherly, so unlike preaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conall, nothing is so wonderful and beautiful
in Christ&#8217;s life as its almost incredible approachableness.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sermon had been preached on the Sabbath
morning and it spiritualized the whole day.
Ian&#8217;s singing also had proved a wonderful service,
for when the young men of that day became old
men, they could be heard leading their crews in
the melodious, longing strains of &#8216;O for the Wings
of a Dove,&#8217; as they sat casting their lines into the
restless water.</p>
<p>In the evening a cold, northwesterly wind
sprang up and Thora and Ian retreated to the
parlour, where a good fire had been built; but
the Bishop and Ragnor and Rahal drew closer
round the hearth in the living room and talked,
and were silent, as their hearts moved them. Rahal
had little to say. She was thinking of Ian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
and of the new life he was going to, and of the
long, lonely days that might be the fate of Thora.
&#8220;The woeful laddie!&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;he has had
but small chances of any kind. What can a lad
do for himself and no mother able to help him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bishop heard or divined her last words and
he said, &#8220;Be content, Rahal. Not one, but many
lives we hold, and our hail to every new work we
begin is our farewell to the old work. Ian is
going to give a Future to his Past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear, Bishop&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear is from the earthward side, Rahal.
Above the clouds of Fear, there is the certain
knowledge of Heaven. Fear is nothing, Faith is
everything!&#8221;</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">There</span> are epochs in every life that cut it
sharply asunder, its continuity is broken
and things can never be the same again. This was
the dominant feeling that came to Thora Ragnor,
as she sat with her mother one afternoon in early
January. It was a day of Orkney&#8217;s most uncomfortable
and depressing kind, the whole island being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
swept by drifting clouds of vapour, which not
only filled the atmosphere but also the houses, so
that everything was to the touch damp and uncomfortable.
Nothing could escape its miserable
contact, even sitting on the hearthstone its power
was felt; and until a good northwester came to
dissipate the damp moisture, nobody expected
much from any one&#8217;s temper.</p>
<p>Thora was restless and unhappy. Her life appeared
to have been suddenly deprived of all joy
and sunshine. She felt as if everything was at an
end, or might as well be, and her mother&#8217;s placid,
peaceful face irritated her. How could she sit
knitting mufflers for the soldiers in the trenches,
and not think of Boris and also of Ian, whom they
had all conspired to send to the same danger and
perhaps death? She could not understand her
mother&#8217;s serenity. It occurred to her this afternoon,
that she might have run away with Ian
to Shetland and there her sisters would have seen
her married; and she did not do this, she obeyed
her parents, and what did she get for it? Loneliness
and misery and her lover sent far away from
her. Oh, those moments when Virtue has failed
to reward us and we regret having served her!
To the young, they are sometimes very bitter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>And her mother&#8217;s calmness! It not only astonished,
it angered her. How could she sit still
and not talk of Boris and Ian? It was a necessary
relief to Thora, their names were at her lips all
day long. But Thora had yet to learn that it is
the middle-aged and the old who have the power
of hoping through everything, because they have
the knowledge that the soul survives all its adventures.
This is the great inspiration, it is the
good wine which God keeps to the last. The old,
the way-worn, the faint and weary, they know this
as the young can never know it.</p>
<p>However, we may say to bad weather, as to all
other bad things, &#8220;this, too, will pass,&#8221; and in a
couple of days the sky was blue, the sun shining,
and the atmosphere fresh and clear and full of
life-giving energy. Ships of all kinds were hastening
into the harbour and the mail boat, broad-bottomed
and strongly built, was in sight. Then
there was a little real anxiety. There was sure to
be letters, what news would they bring? Some
people say there is no romance in these days.
Very far wrong are they. These sealed bits of
white paper hold very often more wonderful romances
than any in the Thousand Nights of story
telling.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>Rahal&#8217;s and Thora&#8217;s anxiety was soon relieved.
A messenger from the warehouse came
quickly to the house, with a letter from Ragnor
to Rahal and a letter from Ian to Thora. Ragnor&#8217;s
letter said they had had a rough voyage
southward, the storm being in their faces all the
way to Leith. There they left the boat and took
a train for London, from which place they went
as quickly as possible to Spithead, fearing to miss
the ship sailing for the Crimea on the eleventh.
Ragnor said he had seen Ian safely away to Sebastopol
and observed that he was remarkably
cheerful and satisfied. He spoke then
of his own delight with London and regretted
that he had not made arrangements which
would permit him to stay a week or two longer
there.</p>
<p>Thora&#8217;s letter was a genuine love letter, for
Ian was deeply in love and everything he said
was in the superlative mood. Lovers like such
letters. They are to them the sacred writings.
It did not seem ridiculous to Thora to be called
&#8220;an angel of beauty and goodness, the rose of
womanhood, the lily on his heart, his star of hope,
the sunshine of his life,&#8221; and many other extravagant
impossibilities. She would have been disappointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
if Ian had been more matter-of-fact and
reasonable.</p>
<p>So there was now comparative happiness in the
house of Ragnor, for though the master&#8217;s letters
were never much more than plain statements of
doings or circumstances, they satisfied Rahal. It
is not every man that knows how to write to a
woman, even if he loves her; but women have a
special divinity in reading love letters, and they
know beyond all doubting the worth of words as
affected by those who use them.</p>
<p>Ragnor gave himself a whole week in London
and before leaving that city for Edinburgh
he wrote a few lines home, saying he intended
to stay in London over the following Sabbath and
hear Canon Liddon preach. On Monday he would
reach Edinburgh and on Tuesday have an interview
with Dr. Macrae and then take the first boat
for home. They could now wait easily, the silence
had been broken, the weather was good, they
had &#8220;The History of Pendennis&#8221; and &#8220;David Copperfield&#8221;
to read, their little duties and little cares
to attend to, and they were not at all unhappy.</p>
<p>At length, the master was to be home <i>that</i> day.
If the wind was favourable, he might arrive about
two o&#8217;clock, but Rahal thought the boat would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
hardly manage it before three with the wind in her
teeth, or it might be nearer four. The house was
all ready for him, spick and span from roof to
cellar and a dinner of the good things he particularly
liked in careful preparation. And, after
all, he came a little earlier than was expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Conall,&#8221; said Rahal, &#8220;I have been
watching for thee, but I thought it would be four
o&#8217;clock, ere thou made Kirkwall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with Donald Farquar sailing the boat.
The way he manages a boat is beyond reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He talks to her, as if she was human. He
scolds and coaxes her and this morning he promised
to paint and gild her figurehead, if she got
into Kirkwall before three. Then every sailor
on board helped her and the wind changed a point
or two and that helped her, and now and then
Farquar pushed her on, with a good or bad word,
and she saved herself by just eleven minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how well thou art looking! Never have
I seen thee so handsome before, never! What
hast thou been doing to Conall Ragnor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell thee. When I had bid Ian good-bye,
I resolved to take a week&#8217;s holiday in London
and as I walked down the Strand, I noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
that every one looked at me, not unkindly but
curiously, and when I looked at the men who
looked at me, I saw we were different. I went
into a barber&#8217;s first, and had my hair cut like Londoners
wear it, short and smart, and not thick and
bushy, like mine was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, thy hair was far too long but they
have cut off all thy curls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the wanting of them. They looked very
womanish. I&#8217;m a deal more purpose-like without
them. Then I went to a first-class tailor-man
and he fit me out with the suit I&#8217;m wearing. He
said it was &#8216;the correct thing for land or water.&#8217;
What dost thou think of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could be more becoming to thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay then, I got a Sabbath Day suit that
shames this one. And I bought a church hat and
a soft hat that beats all, and kid gloves, and a
good walking stick with a fancy knob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art not needing a walking stick for
twenty years yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, the English gentlemen always carries
a walking stick. I think they wouldn&#8217;t know
the way they were going without one. At last,
I went to the shoemakers, and he made me take
off my &#8216;Wellingtons.&#8217; He said no one wore them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
now, and he shod me, as thou sees, very comfortably.
I like the change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they heard Thora calling them, and Ragnor
taking Rahal&#8217;s hand hastened to answer the
call. She was standing at the foot of the stairway,
and her father kissed her and as he did so
whispered&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;All is well, dear one. After dinner,
I will tell thee.&#8221; Then he took her hand, and the
three in one went together to the round table, set
so pleasantly near to the comfortable fireside.
Standing there, hand-clasped, the master said those
few words of adoration and gratitude that turned
the white-spread board into a household altar.
Dinner was on the table and its delicious odours
filled the room and quickly set Ragnor talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you now, what I saw in London,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Ian is a story good enough to keep until
after dinner. I saw him sail away from Spithead,
and he went full of hope and pluck and sure of
success. Then I took the first train back to London.
I got lodgings in a nice little hotel in Norfolk
Street, just off the Strand, and London was
calling me all night long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou could not see much, Father, in one
week,&#8221; said Thora.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the Queen and the Houses of Parliament,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
and I saw the Tower of London and Westminster
Abbey and the Crystal Palace. And I
have heard an oratorio, with a chorus of five hundred
voices and Sims Reeves as soloist. I have
been to Drury Lane, and the Strand Theatres, to
a big picture gallery, and a hippodrome. My
dear ones, the end of one pleasure was just the
beginning of another; in one week, I have lived
fifty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any one can understand how a new flavour
was added to the food they were eating by such
conversation. Not all the sauces in Christendom
could have made it so piquant and appetizing.
Ragnor carved and ate and talked, and Rahal and
Thora listened and laughed and asked endless
questions, and when the mind enters into a meal,
it not only prolongs, it also sweetens and brightens
it. I suppose there may be in every life two
or three festivals, that stand out from all others&ndash;&ndash;small,
unlooked-for meetings, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;where
love, hope, wonder and happy looking-forward,
made the food taste as if it had been cooked in
Paradise. Where, at least for a few hours, a
mortal might feel that man had been made only
a little lower than the angels.</p>
<p>Now, if any of my readers have such a memory,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
let them close the book, shut their eyes and
live it over again. It was probably a foretaste of
a future existence, where we shall have faculties
capable of fuller and higher pleasures; faculties
that without doubt &#8220;will be satisfied.&#8221; For in all
hearts that have suffered, there must abide the
conviction that the Future holds Compensation,
not Punishment.</p>
<p>But without forecast or remembrance, the Ragnors
that night enjoyed their highly mentalised
meal, and after it was over and the table set backward,
and the white hearth brushed free of ashes,
they drew around the fire, and Ragnor laid down
his pipe, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I left London last Monday, and I was in Edinburgh
until Wednesday morning. On Tuesday I
called on Dr. Macrae. I had a letter to give him
from Ian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should Ian have written to him?&#8221; asked
Rahal, in a tone of disapproval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Ian has a good heart, he wrote to his
father. I read the letter. It was all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then did he say to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Rahal, he told his father that he was
leaving for the front, and he wished to leave with
his forgiveness and blessing, if he would give it to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
him. He said that he was sure that in their life-long
dispute he must often have been in the wrong,
and he asked forgiveness for all such lapses of
his duty. He told his father that he had a clear
plan of success before him, but said that in all
cases&ndash;&ndash;fortunate or unfortunate&ndash;&ndash;he would always
remember the name he bore and do nothing
to bring it shame or dishonour. A very good,
brave letter, dear ones. I give Ian credit for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did thou advise him to write it?&#8221; asked Rahal.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it sprang from his own heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou should not have sanctioned it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ian did right, Rahal. I did right to sanction
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, if Ian has a clear plan of success before
him, what is it? He ought to have told us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought it out while we were at sea, he
asked me to explain the matter to you. It is, indeed,
a plan so simple and manifest, that I wonder
we did not propose it at the very first. You
must recollect that Ian was in the employ of Dr.
Finlay of Edinburgh for three years and a half,
and that during that period he acquired both a
large amount of medical knowledge and also of
medical experience. Now we all know that Ian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
has a special gift for this science, especially for its
surgical side, and he is not going to the trenches
or the cavalry, he is going to offer himself to the
Surgical and Medical Corps. He will go to the
battlefield, carry off the wounded, give them first
help, or see them to the hospital. In this way he
will be doing constant good to others and yet be
forwarding the career which is to make his future
happy and honourable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Ian has decided to be a surgeon,
Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I can tell thee, Thora, he has not set
himself a task beyond his power. I think very
highly of Ian, no one could help doing so; and see
here, Thora! I have a letter in my pocket for
thee! He gave it to me as I bid him good-bye at
Spithead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so happy, Father! So happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast good reason to be happy. We shall
all be proud of Ian in good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did thou give Ian&#8217;s letter to his father&#8217;s
hands, or did thou mail it, Coll?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave it to him, personally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was thy first impression of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave me first of all an ecclesiastical impression.
I just naturally looked for a gown or surplice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
He wanted something without one. He
met me coldly but courteously, and taking Ian&#8217;s
letter from me, placed it deliberately upon a
pile of letters lying on his desk. I said, &#8216;It is
from thy son, Doctor, perhaps thou had better
read it at once. It is a good letter, sir, read
it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He bowed, and asked if Ian was with me.
I said, &#8216;No, sir, he is on his way to Scutari.&#8217; Then
he was silent. After a few moments he asked me
if I had been in Edinburgh during the past Sabbath.
&#8216;You should have been here,&#8217; he added,
&#8216;then you could have heard the great Dr. Chalmers
preach.&#8217; I told him that I had spent that
never-to-be-forgotten Sabbath under the blessed
dome of St. Paul&#8217;s in London. I said something
about the transcending beauty of the wonderful
music of the cathedral service, and spoke with delight
of the majestic nave, filled with medi&aelig;val
rush-bottomed chairs for the worshippers, and I
told him how much more fitting they were in the
House of God than pews.&#8221; And Ragnor uttered
the last word with a new-found emphasis. &#8220;He
asked, quite scornfully, in what sense I found them
more fitting, and I answered rather warmly&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Why,
sir, sitting together in chairs, we felt so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
much more at home. We were like one great family
in our Father&#8217;s house.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the chairs rented?&#8221; asked Rahal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rented!&#8221; cried Ragnor scornfully. &#8220;No, indeed!
There are no dear chairs and no cheap
chairs, all are equal and all are free. I never felt
so like worshipping in a church before. The religious
spirit had free way in our midst.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Macrae say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, he supposed the rush chairs were an
&#8216;Armenian innovation&#8217;; and I answered, &#8216;The
pews, sir, they are the innovation.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did thou have any argument with him? I
have often heard Ian say he plunged into religious
argument with every one he met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Rahal, I don&#8217;t know how it happened,
but I quickly found myself in a good atmosphere
of contradictions. I do not remember either what
I had been saying, but I heard him distinctly assert,
that &#8216;it was the Armenians who had described
the Calvinists, and they had not wasted their opportunities.&#8217;
Then I found myself telling him that
Armenianism had ruled the religious world ever
since the birth of Christianity; but that Calvinism
was a thing of yesterday, a mere Geneva opinion.
Rahal, the man has a dogma for a soul, and yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
through this hard veil, I could see that he was
full of a longing for love; but he has not found out
the way to love, his heart is ice-bound. He made
me say things I did not want to say, he stirred my
soul round and round until it boiled over, and
then the words would come. Really, Rahal, I
did not know the words were in my mind, till
his aggravating questions made me say them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What words? Art thou troubled about
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little. He was talking of faith and doubt,
especially as it referred to the Bible, and I listened
until I could bear it no longer. He was asking
what proof there was for this, and that, and
the other, and as I said, he got me stirred up beyond
myself and I told him I cared nothing about
proofs. I said proofs were for sceptics and not
for good men who <i>knew</i> in whom they had believed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Coll, that was enough, was it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for Macrae. He said immediately, &#8216;Suppose
there was no divine authority for the scheme
of morals and divinity laid down in this Book,&#8217;
and he laid his hand reverently on the Bible,
&#8216;where should we be?&#8217; And I told him, we should
be just where we were, because God&#8217;s commands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
were written on every conscience and that these
commands would stand firm even if creeds became
dust, and Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Paul,
all failed and passed away. &#8216;Power of God!&#8217; I
cried, as I struck the table with my fist, &#8216;it takes
God&#8217;s tireless, patient, eternal love to put up with
puny men, always doubting Him. I believe in
God the Father Almighty, the Maker of heaven
and earth!&#8217; I said, &#8216;and I want no proofs about
Him in whom I believe.&#8217; By this time, Rahal, he
had me on fire. I was ready to deny anything he
asserted, especially about hell, for thou knows,
Rahal, that there are hells in this world and no
worse needed. So when he asked if I believed in
the Calvinistic idea of hell, I answered, &#8216;I deny
it! My soul denies it&ndash;&ndash;utterly!&#8217; I reminded him
that God spoke to Dives in hell and called him son
and that Dives, even there, clung to the fatherhood
of God. And I told him this world was a
hell to those who deserved hell, and a place of
much trial to most men and women, and I thought
it was poor comfort to preach to such, that the
next world was worse. There now! I have told
you enough. He asked me to lunch with him, and
I did; and I told him as we ate, what a fine fellow
Ian was, and he listened and was silent.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then you saw Ian&#8217;s mother and sister?&#8221; asked
Thora.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not. They had gone for the winter
to the Bridge of Allan. Mrs. Macrae is sick,
her husband seemed unhappy about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahal hoped now that her home would settle
itself into its usual calm, methodical order. She
strove to give to every hour its long accustomed
duty, and to infuse an atmosphere of rest and of
&#8220;use and wont&#8221; into every day&#8217;s affairs. It was
impossible. The master of the house had suffered
a world change. He had tasted of strange pleasures
and enthusiasms, and was secretly planning a
life totally at variance with his long accustomed
routine and responsibilities. He did not speak
of the things in his heart but nevertheless they
escaped him.</p>
<p>Very soon he began to have much more regular
communication with his sons in Shetland, and
finally he told Rahal that he intended taking his
son Robert into partnership. Such changes grew
slowly in Ragnor&#8217;s mind, and much more slowly
in practice, but Rahal knew that they were steadily
working to some ultimate, and already definite
and determined end in her husband&#8217;s will.</p>
<p>The absent also exerted a far greater power
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
upon the home than any one believed. Ian&#8217;s letters
came with persistent regularity, and the influence
of one was hardly spent, when another arrived
of quite a different character. Ian was rapidly
realizing his hopes. He had been gladly
taken into a surgical corps, under the charge of a
Doctor Frazer, and his life was a continual drama
of stirring events. Generally he wrote between actions,
and then he described the gallant young men
resting on the slopes of the beleaguered hill, with
their weapons at their finger tips, but always cheerful.
Sometimes he spoke of them under terrible
fire in their life-or-death push forward, followed
by the surgeons and stretcher-bearers. Sometimes,
he had been to the trenches to dress a wound that
would not stop bleeding, but always he wondered
at seeing the resolute grit and calmness of these
young men, who had been the dandies in London
drawing-rooms a year ago and who were now
smoking placidly in the trenches at Redan.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked an old surgeon, on
whom he was waiting. &#8220;Is it recklessness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;It is straight
courage. Courage in the blood. Courage nourished
on their mother&#8217;s milk. Courage educated
into them at Eton or Rugby, in many a fight and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
scuffle. Courage that lived with them night and
day at Oxford or Cambridge, and that made them
choose danger and death rather than be known
for one moment as a cad or a coward. It was
dancing last year. It is fighting in a proper quarrel
this year. Different duties, that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every now and then Sunna dropped them letters
about which there was much pleasant speculating,
for as the summer came forward, she began
to accept the disappointments made by the
death of Boris, and to consider what possibilities
of life were still within her power. She said in
May that &#8220;she was sick and weary of everything
about Sebastopol, and that she wanted to go back
to Scotland, far more frantically than she ever
wanted to leave it.&#8221; In June, she said, she had
got her grandfather to listen to reason, but had
been forced to cry for what she wanted, a humiliation
beyond all apologies.</p>
<p>Her next letter was written in Edinburgh,
where she declared she intended to stay for some
time. Maximus Grant was in Edinburgh with
his little brother, who was under the care and
treatment of an eminent surgeon living there.
&#8220;The poor little laddie is dying,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
I am able to help him over many bad hours, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
Max is not half-bad, that is, he might be worse if
left to himself. Heigh-ho! What varieties of
men, and varieties of their trials, poor women
have to put up with!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the year advanced Sunna&#8217;s letters grew
bright and more and more like her, and she described
with admirable imitative piquancy the literary
atmosphere and conversation which is Edinburgh&#8217;s
native air. In the month of November,
little Eric went away suddenly, in a paroxysm of
military enthusiasm, dying literally the death of a
soldier &#8220;with tumult, with shouting, and with the
sound of the trumpets,&#8221; in his soul&#8217;s hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We adored him,&#8221; wrote Sunna, in her most
fervent religious mood, which was just as sincere
as any other mood. &#8220;He was such a loving, clever
little soul, and he lay so long within the hollow of
Death&#8217;s sickle. There he heard and saw wonderful
things, that I would not dare to speak of.
Max has wept very sincerely. It is my lot apparently,
to administer drops of comfort to him.
In this world, I find that women can neither hide
nor run away from men and their troubles, the
moment anything goes wrong with them, they fly
to some woman and throw their calamity on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to see which way Sunna is drifting,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
said Rahal, after this letter had been read. &#8220;She
will marry Maximus Grant, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, her grandfather wishes that marriage.
It is very suitable. His silent, masterful
way will cure Sunna&#8217;s faults.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will do nothing of the kind. What the
cradle rocks, the spade buries. If Sunna lives to
be one hundred years old&ndash;&ndash;a thing not unlikely&ndash;&ndash;she
will be Sunna. Just Sunna.&#8221;</p>
<p>During all this summer, Ragnor was deeply
engrossed in his business, and the Vedders remained
in Edinburgh, as did also Mistress Brodie,
though she had had all the best rooms in her
Kirkwall house redecorated. &#8220;It is her hesitation
about grandfather. She will, and she won&#8217;t,&#8221;
wrote Sunna, &#8220;and she keeps grandfather hanging
by a hair.&#8221; Then she made a few scornful remarks
about &#8220;the hesitating <i>liaisons</i> of old women&#8221;
and concluded that it all depended upon the
marriage ceremony.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grandfather [she wrote] wants to sneak into some
out of the way little church, and get the business over
as quickly and quietly as possible; and Mistress Brodie
has dreams of a peach-bloom satin gown, and a white
lace bonnet. She thought &#8220;that was enough for a
second affair&#8221;; and when I gently hoped that it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
at least an affair of the heart, she said with a distinct
snap, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be impertinent, Miss!&#8221; However, all this
is but the overture to the great matrimonial drama, and
it is rather interesting.</p>
<p>I saw by a late London paper that Thora&#8217;s lover has
gone and got himself decorated, or crossed, for doing
some dare-devil sort of thing about wounded men. I
wonder how Thora will like to walk on Pall Mall with
a man who wears a star or a medal on his breast. Such
things make women feel small. For, of course, we
could win stars and medals if we had the chance.
Max considers Ian &#8220;highly praise-worthy.&#8221; Max
lately has a way of talking in two or three syllables. I
am trying to remember where I left my last spelling
book; I fear I shall have to get up my orthography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of this year A. D. 1855 was one of
commonplaces stirred by tragic events. It is this
conjunction that makes the most prosaic of lives
always a story. It only taught Thora and Rahal
to make the most of such pleasures as were within
their reach. In the evening Ragnor was always
ready to share what they had to offer, but in the
daytime he was getting his business into such perfect
condition that he could leave it safely in
charge of his son Robert for a year, or more, if
that was his wish.</p>
<p>On the second of March, the Czar Nicholas
died, and there was good hope in that removal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
In June, General Raglan died of cholera, and on
the following fifth of September, the Russians,
finding they could no longer defend Sebastopol,
blew up its defences and also its two immense
magazines of munitions. This explosion was terrific,
the very earth appeared to reel. The town
they deliberately set on fire. Then on Sunday
morning, September the ninth, the English and
French took possession of the great fortress,
though it was not until the last day of February,
A. D. 1856, that the treaty of peace was
signed.</p>
<p>After the occupation of Sebastopol, however,
there was a cessation of hostilities, and the hospitals
rapidly began to empty and the physicians and
surgeons to return home. Dr. Frazer remained at
his post till near Christmas, and was then able
to leave the few cases remaining in the charge of
competent nurses. Ian remained at his side and
they returned to England together. It was then
within a few days of Christmas, and Ian hastened
northward without delay.</p>
<p>There was no hesitating welcome for him now;
he was met by the truest and warmest affection, he
was cheerfully given the honour which he had
faithfully won. And the wedding day was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
longer delayed, it was joyfully hastened forward.
Bishop Hedley, the Vedders and Maximus Grant
had already arrived and the little town was all
agog and eager for the delayed ceremony. Sunna
had brought with her Thora&#8217;s new wedding dress
and the day had been finally set for the first of
January.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou will begin a fresh life with a fresh
year,&#8221; said Rahal to her daughter. &#8220;A year on
which, as yet, no tears have fallen; and which has
not known care or crossed purpose. On its first
page thou will write thy marriage joy and thy
new hopes, and the light of a perfect love will be
over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime life was full of new delights
to Thora. Wonderful things were happening to
her every day. The wedding dress was here.
Adam Vedder had brought her a pretty silver tea
service, Aunt Barbie&ndash;&ndash;now Madame Vedder&ndash;&ndash;had
remembered her in many of those womanwise
ways, that delight the heart of youth. Even Dominie
Macrae had sent her a gold watch, and the
little sister-in-law had chosen for her gift some
very pretty laces. Rich and poor alike brought
her their good-will offerings, and many old Norse
awmries were ransacked in the search for jewels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
or ornaments of the jade stone, which all held as
&#8220;luck beyond breaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The present which pleased Thora most of all
was a new wedding-dress, the gift of her mother.
The rich ivory satin was perfect and peerless in its
exquisite fit and simplicity; jewels, nor yet lace,
could have added nothing to it. Sunna had
brought it with her own toilet. In fact, she was
ready to make a special sensation with it on the
first of January, for her wedding garment as
Thora&#8217;s bridesmaid was nothing less than a robe
of gold and white shot silk, worn over a hoop.
She had been wearing a hoop all winter in Edinburgh,
but she was quite sure she would be the
first &#8220;hooped lady&#8221; to appear in Kirkwall town.
Thora might wear the bride veil, with its wreath
of myrtle and rosemary, but she had a pleasant
little laugh, as she mentally saw herself in the
balloon of white and gold shot silk, walking majestically
up the nave of St. Magnus. It was so
long since hoops had been worn. None of the
present generation of Kirkwall women could ever
have seen a lady in a hoop, and behind the present
generation there was no likelihood of any
hooped ladies in Kirkwall.</p>
<p>Thora had no hoop. Her orders had been positively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
against it and unless Madame Vedder had
slipped inside &#8220;the bell&#8221; she could not imagine any
rival. As she made this reflection, she smiled,
and then translated the smile into the thought, &#8220;If
she has, she will look like a haystack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Ian&#8217;s military suit in his department had
been of white duff or linen, plentifully adorned
with gilt buttons and bands representing some distinctive
service. It was the secret desire of Ian
to wear this suit, and he rather felt that Thora or
his mother-in-law should ask him to do so. For
he knew that its whiteness and gilt, and tiny knots
of ribbon, gave to the wearer that military air,
which all men yearn a little after. He wished to
wear it on his wedding day but Thora had not
thought of it, neither had Sunna. However, on
the 29th, Rahal, that kind, wise woman, asked
him as a special favour, to wear his medical uniform.
She said, &#8220;the townsfolk would be so disappointed
with black broadcloth and a pearl-grey
waistcoat. They longed to see him as he went
onto the battlefield, to save or succour the
wounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mother,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I went in the
plainest linen suit to bring in the wounded and
dying.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I know, dear one, but they do not know, and
it is not worth while destroying an innocent illusion,
we have so few of them as we grow old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Mother, it shall be as you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course Ian wished to wear it,&#8221; said Sunna.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Sunna, you must not judge all men from
Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am far from that folly. Your father has
been watching the winds and the clouds all day.
So have I. Conall Ragnor is always picturesque,
even poetical. I feel safe if I follow him. He
says it will be fine tomorrow. I hope so!&#8221;</p>
<p>This hope was more than justified. It was a
day of sunshine and little wandering south winds,
and the procession was a fact. Now Ragnor
knew that this marriage procession, as a national
custom, was passing away, but it had added its
friendliness to his own and all his sons&#8217; and daughters&#8217;
weddings and he wanted Thora&#8217;s marriage
ceremonial to include it. &#8220;When thou art an old
woman, Thora,&#8221; he said to her, &#8220;then thou wilt
be glad to have remembered it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At length the New Year dawned and the day
arrived. All was ready for it. There was no
hurry, no fret, no uncertainty. Thora rode to
the cathedral in the Vedder&#8217;s closed carriage with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
her father and mother. Ian was with Maximus
and Sunna in the Galt landeau. Adam Vedder and
his bride rode together in their open Victoria and
all were ready as the clock struck ten. Then a
little band of stringed instruments and young men
took their place as leaders of the procession, and
when they started joyfully &#8220;Room for the Bride!&#8221;
the carriages took the places assigned them and
about two hundred men and women, who had
gathered at the Ragnor House, followed in procession,
many joining in the singing.</p>
<p>The cathedral was crowded when they reached
it, and Dr. Hedley in white robes came forward
to meet the bride and, with smiles and loving good
will, to unite her forever to the choice of her soul.</p>
<p>It was almost a musical marriage. Melody began
and followed and closed the whole ceremonial.
About twenty returned with the bridal party
to the Ragnor House to eat the bridal dinner, but
the general townsfolk were to have their feast and
dance in the Town Hall about seven in the evening.
The Bishop stayed only to bless the meal,
for the boat was waiting that was to carry him to
a Convocation of the Church then sitting in Edinburgh.
But he wore his sprig of rosemary on his
vest, and he stood at Ragnor&#8217;s right hand and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
watched him mix the Bride Cup, watched him
mingle in one large silver bowl of pre-Christian
age the pale, delicious sherry and fine sugar and
spices and stir the whole with a strip of rosemary.
Then every guest stood up and was served
with a cup, most of them having in their hand a
strip of rosemary to stir it with. And after the
Bishop had blessed the bride and blessed the bridegroom,
he said, &#8220;I will quote for you a passage
from an old sermon and after it, you will stir your
cup again with rosemary and grow it still more
plentifully in your gardens.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rosemary is for married men and man
challengeth it, as belonging properly to himself.
It helpeth the brain, strengtheneth the memory,
and affects kindly the heart. Let this flower of
man ensign your wisdom, love and loyalty, and
carry it, not only in your hands, but in your heads
and hearts.&#8221; Then he lifted his glass and stirred
the wine with his strip of rosemary, and as he did
so all followed his example, while he repeated
from an old romance the following lines:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>... &#8220;Before we divide,<br />
Let us dip our rosemaries<br />
In one rich bowl of wine, to this brave girl<br />
And to the gentleman.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>With these words he departed, and the utmost
and happiest interchange of all kinds of good fellowship
followed. Every man and woman was at
perfect ease and ready to give of the best they
had. Even Adam Vedder delighted all, and especially
his happy-looking bride, by his clever condensation
of Sunna&#8217;s favourite story of &#8220;The
Banded Men.&#8221; No finished actor could have made
it, in its own way, a finer model of dramatic narrative,
especially in its quaint reversal of the parts
usually played by father and son, into those of
the prodigal father and the money-loving, prudent
son. Then a little whisper went round the table
and it sprang from Sunna, and people smiled and
remembered that Adam had won his wife from
three younger men than himself and, as if by a
single, solid impulse, they stirred their wine cups
once more and called for a cheer for the old bridegroom,
who had been faithful for forty years to
his first love and had then walked off with her,
from Provost, Lawyer and Minister; all of them
twenty years younger than himself.</p>
<p>Getting near to three o&#8217;clock, they began to sing
and Rahal was pleased to hear that sound of
peace, for several guests were just from the battlefield
and quite as ready for a quarrel as a song.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Also during the little confusion of removing fruit
and cake and glasses, and the substitution of the
cups and saucers and the strong, hot, sweet tea
that every Norseman loves, Ian and Thora slipped
away without notice. Max Grant&#8217;s carriage put
them in half-an-hour on the threshold of their own
home. They crossed it hand and hand and Ian
kissed the hand he held and Thora raised her face
in answer; but words have not yet been invented
that can speak for such perfect happiness.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>Love is rich in his own right,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>He is heir of all the spheres,<br />
In his service day and night<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Swing the tides and roll the years.<br />
What has he to ask of fate?<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Crown him, glad or desolate.<br />

<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>His the solemn mysteries.<br />
Crown him! In his darkest day<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>He has Heaven to give away!</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Ian&#8217;s business arrangements curtailed the length
of any festivity in relation to the marriage. He
had already signed an agreement with Dr. Frazer
to return to him as soon as possible after the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
twelfth day and remain as his assistant until he
was fully authenticated a surgeon by the proper
schools. In the meantime he would enter the
London School of Medicine and Surgery and give
to Dr. Frazer all the time not demanded by its
hours and exercises. For this attention Ian was
to receive from Dr. Frazer one hundred pounds
a year. Furthermore, when Ian had received the
proper authority to call himself Dr. John Macrae,
he was to have the offer of a partnership with Dr.
Frazer, on what were considered very favourable
terms.</p>
<p>So their little romance was at last happily over.
Ian was an infinitely finer and nobler man. He
had dwelt amid great acts and great suffering for
a year and had not visited the House of Mourning
in vain. All that was light and trifling had
fallen away from him. He regarded his life and
talents now as a great and solemn charge and was
resolved to make them of use to his fellows. And
Thora was lovelier than she had ever been. She
had learned self-restraint and she had hoped
through evil days, till good days came; so then,
she knew how to look for good when all appeared
wrong and by faith and will, bring good out of
evil.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>After Thora and her husband left for London
a great change took place in the Ragnor home.
Ragnor had been preparing for it ever since his
visit to London and, within a month, Robert Ragnor
and his wife and family came from Shetland
and took possession. It gave Rahal a little pain
to see any woman in her place but that was nothing,
she was going to give her dear Coll the dream
of his life. She was going to travel with him, and
see all the civilized countries in the world! She
was going to London first, and last, of all!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>SEQUENCES</h3>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Not</span> long ago I found in a list of Orkney and
Shetland literature several volumes by a
Conall Ragnor, two of them poetry. But that just
tended to certify a suspicion. Sixty years ago I
had heard him repeat some Gallic poems and had
known instinctively, though only a girl of eighteen,
that the man was a poet.</p>
<p>It roused in me a curiosity I felt it would be
pleasant to gratify, and so a little while after I
began this story, I wrote to a London newspaper
man and asked him to send me some of his Orkney
exchanges. I have a habit of trusting newspaper
editors and I found this one as I expected,
willing and obliging. He sent me two Orkney
papers and the first thing I noticed was the prevalence
of the old names. Among them I saw Mrs.
Max Grant, and I thought I would write to her
and take my chance of the lady turning out to be
the old Sunna Vedder. It was quite a possibility,
as we were apparently about the same age when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
I saw her. It was only for an hour or two in
the evening we met, at the Ragnor house, but
girls see a deal in an hour or two and if I remembered
her, she had doubtless chronicled an opinion
of me.</p>
<p>In about five weeks Mrs. Grant&#8217;s letter in answer
to mine arrived. She began it by saying
she remembered me, because I wore a hat, a sailor&#8217;s
hat, and she said it was the first hat she ever
saw on a woman&#8217;s head. She said also, that I
told her women were beginning to wear them for
shopping and walking and driving, or out at sea,
but never for church or visiting. All of which
I doubtless said, for it was my first hat. And I
do not remember women wearing hats at all until
about this time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suppose [she continued] thou wants to know first
of all about the Vedders. They were <i>the</i> people then,
and they have not grown a bit smaller, nor do they
think any less of themselves yet. My grandfather
married again and was not sorry for it. I don&#8217;t know
whether his wife was sorry or not. I took Maximus
Grant for a husband for, after Boris Ragnor died, I
did not care who I took, provided he had plenty of
good qualities and plenty of gold. We lived together
thirty years very respectably. I took my way and I
usually expected him to do the same. We had four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
sons, and they have nine sons among them, and all of
the nine are now fighting the vipers they have been
coddling for forty or fifty years. Some are in the
regular army, some in the navy, and some in the
plucky, fighting little navy, patrolling England and
her brood of coastwise islands. They are a tough,
rough, hard lot, but I love them all better than anything
else in this world. There are a good many Vedder
houses in Orkney, and they are all full of little
squabbling, fighting, never clean, and never properly
dressed little brats, from four to eleven years old. So
I don&#8217;t worry about there being Vedders enough to
run things the way they want them run.</p>
<p>The Ragnors are here in plenty. All the men are at
the war, all the women running fishing boats or keeping
general shops, to which I like to see the Germans
going. They are told what kind of people they are
as they walk up to the shops; and they get what they
want at an impoverishing price. Serve them right!
Men, however, will pay any money for a thing they
want.</p>
<p>There has not been such good times in Orkney since
I was born, as there is now. We have an enemy to
beat in trade and an enemy to beat in fight at our
very doors, and our men are neither to hold nor to bind,
they are that top-lofty. War is a man&#8217;s native air. My
sons and grandsons are all two inches taller than they
were and they defy Nature to contradict them. I
never attempt it. Well, then, they are proper men in
all things, a little hard to deal with and masterful, but
just as I wish them. My grandfather died fifty years
ago, he might have lived longer if he had not married.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
His widow wept in the deepest black and people
thought she was sorry.</p>
<p>The Ragnors are mostly here and in Shetland. Conall
Ragnor never really settled down again. Rahal and
he lived in Edinburgh or London, when not travelling.
I heard that Conall wrote books and really got money
for them. I cannot believe that. Rahal died first.
Conall lived a month after her. They were laid in
earth in Stromness Church-yard. My grandfather
wanted to bring the body of Boris home and bury it in
Stromness, and I would not let him. He is all mine
where he sleeps in the Crimea. I don&#8217;t want him
among a congregation of his brothers and sisters and
uncles and aunts.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>I suppose thou must have heard of Thora&#8217;s husband.
He really did become famous, and I was told his father
forgave him all his youthful follies. It was said Thora
managed that in some clever way; but I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t
know what to say. Thora never seemed at all clever
to me. She had many children, but she died long ago,
though she did live long enough to see her husband
knighted and her eldest boy marry the daughter of a
lord. I have no doubt she was happy in her own way,
only she never did dress herself as a person in the best
society ought to have done. I once told her so. &#8220;Well,
then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I dress to please my husband.&#8221; Imagine
such simplicity! As to myself I am getting near
to ninety, but I live a good life and God helps me. I
have kept my fine hair and complexion and I run
around on my little errands quite comfortably. Indeed
I am sunwise able for everything I want. I
shall be glad to hear from thee again, and if thou wilt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
send me occasionally some of those delightful American
papers, thou wilt make me much thy debtor. Also,
I want thee to tell all the brave young Americans thou
knows that if they would like a real life on the ocean
wave, they ought to join our wonderful patrol round
the English coast. They will learn more and see
more and feel more in a month, in this little interfering
navy, than they&#8217;d learn in a lifetime in a first-class
man-of-war.</p>
<p>Write to me again and then we shall have tied our
friendship with a three-fold letter. Thine, with all
good will and wishes,</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Sunna Vedder Grant.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a woman&#8217;s letter and it must have a
postscript. It is only two lines of John Stuart
Blackie&#8217;s, and it should have been at the beginning,
but it will touch your heart at the end as well
as at the beginning.</p>
